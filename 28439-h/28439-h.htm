<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>The Veterans of Ryeville</h3>
</div>
<p>Ryeville had rather prided itself on having
the same population&mdash;about three thousand&mdash;for
the last fifty years. That is the oldest inhabitants
had, but the newer generation was for
expansion in spite of tradition, and Ryeville
awoke one morning, after the census taker had
been busying himself, to find itself five thousand
strong and still growing.</p>
<p>There was no especial reason for the growth
of the little town, save that it lay in the heart
of rolling blue-grass country and people have to
live somewhere. And Ryeville, with its crooked
streets and substantial homes, was as good a
place as any. There were churches of all
denominations, schools and shops, a skating rink,
two motion picture houses and as many drug
stores as there had been barrooms before prohibition
made necessary a change of front.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
There were two hotels&mdash;one where you
&#8220;could&#8221; and one where you &#8220;couldn&#8217;t.&#8221; The
former was frequented by the old men of the
town and county. It stood next to the courthouse.
Indeed its long, shady porch overlooked
the courthouse green. There the old men would
sit with chairs tilted against the wall and feet
on railing and sadly watch the prohibition
officers hauling bootleggers to court.</p>
<p>There were a great many old men in Ryeville
and the country around&mdash;more old men than
old women, in spite of the fact that that part
of Kentucky had furnished its quota of recruits
for both Union and Rebel armies.</p>
<p>In Kentucky, during the war between the
states, brother had been pitted against brother&mdash;even
father against son. The fact that the
state did not secede from the Union had been a
reason for the most intense bitterness and ill
feeling among families and former friends. The
bitterness was gone now and ill feeling forgotten.
The veterans of the blue and the gray sat
on the Rye House porch together, swapping
tales and borrowing tobacco as amicably as
though they had never done their best to exterminate
one another.</p>
<p>&#8220;As for Abe Lincoln,&#8221; declared Major Fitch,
an ancient confederate, &#8220;if it hadn&#8217;t been for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
him Gawd knows what we&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; had to talk about
in these dry days. I tell you, sah, we ought to
be eternally grateful to Abe Lincoln. I for one
am. I was a clerk in a country store when the
war broke out and I&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; been there yet if it
wasn&#8217;t for the war. I&#8217;m here to say it made me
and made my fam&#8217;ly. We were bawn fighters&mdash;my
fo&#8217; brothers and I&mdash;and up to the sixties
we were always in trouble for brawling. The
war came along and made a virtue of our vices.
My mother used to be mighty &#8217;shamed when she
heard we were called the &#8216;Fighting Fitches.&#8217;
That was befo&#8217; the war, and one or the other of
us boys was always up befo&#8217; the co&#8217;t for wild
carrying on. But, bless Bob, when we were
called &#8216;Fighting Fitches&#8217; for whipping the
Yankees the old lady was as pleased as Punch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did they call ye fer not bein&#8217; able to
whup us?&#8221; asked a grinning old giant from the
mountains.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothin&#8217;&mdash;&#8217;cause we were able. All we
needed was mo&#8217; men and mo&#8217; food and mo&#8217; guns.
We&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; licked the spots off of you Yanks if we
had had a chance. You wouldn&#8217;t stand still
long enough to get whipped.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the talk went on, day in and day out. Battles
were fought over and over but never finished.
They always ended with a draw and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
could be resumed the next morning with added
zest and new incidents. One old man, Pete
Barnes, who had the distinction of being the
only private who frequented the porch at Rye
House, always claimed to have been present at
every battle mentioned&mdash;even Bunker Hill and
the battle of New Orleans.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes sirree, I was there; nothin&#8217; but a youngster,
but I was there!&#8221; he would assert. &#8220;There
wasn&#8217;t a single battle the Fo&#8217;th Kentucky Volunteers
didn&#8217;t get in on an&#8217; the Johnny Rebs
would run like hell when they heard we were
comin&#8217;. I tell you when we got them a goin&#8217;
was at Fredericksburg in &#8217;62&mdash;must have been
&#8217;bout the middle of December. We beat &#8217;em
even worse than we did at Chickamauga the following
year.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw dry up, Pete. You know perfectly well
the Yanks got licked at both of those battles,&#8221;
a jovial opponent would declare, but Pete
Barnes was as sure his side had won as he was
that he had been present at the surrender of
Cornwallis and there was no use in trying to
persuade him otherwise.</p>
<p>The Rye House faced on Main Street and
nothing happened on that thoroughfare that
escaped the oldsters on the porch. If anything
was going on all they had to do was move their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
chairs from the side porch to the front, whether
it was a circus parade or a funeral, or just Miss
Ann Peyton&#8217;s rickety coach bearing her to Buck
Hill, which was the first large farm the other
side of the creek, the dividing line between Ryeville
and the country. There were several small
places but Buck Hill the only one of importance.</p>
<p>On a morning in June the old men sat on the
porch as usual, with feet on railing and chairs
tilted to the right angle for aged backbones.
Nothing much had happened all morning. The
sun was about the only thing that was moving
in Ryeville and that had finally got around to
the side porch and was shining full on Colonel
Crutcher&#8217;s outstretched legs.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon we&#8217;d better move,&#8221; he said wearily.
&#8220;Th&#8217;ain&#8217;t much peace and quiet these days, what
with the sun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Heat&#8217;s something awful,&#8221; agreed Pete
Barnes, &#8220;but it ain&#8217;t a patchin&#8217; on what it was
at Cowpens.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cowpens!&#8221; exclaimed a necktie drummer
who was stopping at the Rye House for a day
or so, &#8220;I thought Cowpens was a battle fought
between the United States and the English back
in 1781.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, sure!&#8221; agreed Pete, &#8220;I was a mere
lad, but I was there.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It was in January, too,&#8221; persisted the drummer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, but we made it so hot for the&mdash;for
the other side that this June weather is
nothin&#8217; to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a general laugh and moving of
chairs out of the rays of the inconsiderate sun.</p>
<p>&#8220;By golly, we&#8217;re just in time,&#8221; said Colonel
Crutcher. &#8220;There comes Miss Ann Peyton&#8217;s
rockaway. Where do you reckon she&#8217;s bound
for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord knows, but I hope she&#8217;s not in a
hurry,&#8221; said Judge Middleton&mdash;judge from
courtesy only, having sat on no bench but the
anxious bench at the races and being a judge
solely of horses and whiskey. &#8220;Did you ever see
such snails as that old team? Good Golddust
breed too! Miss Ann always buys good horses
when she does buy but to my certain knowledge
that pair is eighteen years old. Pretty nigh
played out by now but I reckon they&#8217;ll outlast
old Billy and Miss Ann.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon the old lady has to do some
scrimpin&#8217; to buy a new pair,&#8221; said Major Fitch.
&#8220;By golly, I remember when she was the best-looking
gal in the county&mdash;or any other county
for that matter. She was engaged to a fellow in
my regiment&mdash;killed at Appomattox. She had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
more beaux than you could shake a stick at, but
I reckon she couldn&#8217;t get over Bert Mason. She
wasn&#8217;t much more than a child when the war
broke out, but the war aged the girls as it did
the boys.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hear tell Miss Ann is on the move right
smart lately,&#8221; ventured Pete Barnes.</p>
<p>&#8220;So they tell me,&#8221; continued Major Fitch.
&#8220;I tell you, havin&#8217; comp&#8217;ny now isn&#8217;t what it
used to be, what with wages up sky-high and
all the niggers gone to Indianapolis and Chicago
so there aren&#8217;t any to pay even if you had the
money, and food costin&#8217; three times what it&#8217;s
wuth. I reckon it is no joke to have Miss Ann
a fallin&#8217; in on her kin nowadays with two
horses that must have oats and that old Billy to
fill up besides.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and Little Josh tells me Miss Ann
is always company wherever she stays,&#8221; said the
Judge. &#8220;He wasn&#8217;t exactly complaining but
just kind of explaining. You see his wife, that
last one, just up and said she wouldn&#8217;t and she
wouldn&#8217;t. I reckon Miss Ann kind of wore out
her welcome last time she was there because she
came just when Mrs. Little Josh was planning
a trip to White Sulphur and Miss Ann wouldn&#8217;t
take the hint and the journey had to be put off
and then the railroad strike came along and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
Little Josh was afraid to let his wife start for
fear she couldn&#8217;t get back. Mrs. Little Josh is
as sore as can be about it and threatens if Miss
Ann comes any more that she will invite all of
her own kin at the same time and see which side
can freeze out the other. The old lady hasn&#8217;t
been there this year and she hasn&#8217;t been to Big
Josh&#8217;s either. Big Josh&#8217;s daughters have read
the riot act, so I hear, and they say if their old
cousin comes to them without being invited they
are going to try some visiting on their own hook
and leave Big Josh to do the entertaining.
They say he is great on big talk about family
ties and the obligations of kinship but that they
have all the trouble and when their Cousin Ann
Peyton visits them he simply takes himself off
and leaves them to do the work. Big Josh lives
up such a muddy lane it&#8217;s hard to keep servants.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Ann&#8217;s lumbering carriage had hardly
reached the far corner when the attention of the
old men on the porch was arrested by a small,
low-swung motor car of the genus runabout. No
doubt its motor and wheels had been turned out
of a factory but the rest of it was plainly home
made. It was painted a bright blue. The rear
end might have applied for a truck license, as
it was evidently intended as a bearer of burdens,
but the front part had the air of a racer and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
eager young girl at the wheel looked as though
she might be more in sympathy with the front
of her car than the back. Be that as it may,
she was determined not to let her sympathies
run away with her but, much to the delight of
the dull old men on the Rye House porch, she
stopped her car directly in front of them and
carefully rearranged a number of mysterious-looking
parcels in the truck end of her car.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hiyer, Miss Judith?&#8221; called Pete Barnes.
The girl must stop her engine to hear what the
old man was saying.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; she called back gaily.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just said hiyer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine! Hiyer, yourself?&#8221; she laughed pleasantly,
although stopping the engine entailed
getting out and cranking, since her car boasted
no self-starter.</p>
<p>All of the old men bowed familiarly to the
girl and indulged in some form of pleasantry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bootlegging now, or what are you up to?&#8221;
asked Major Fitch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Worse than that&mdash;perfumes and soaps,
tooth pastes and cold creams, hair tonics and
henna dips, silver polish and spot removers&mdash;pretty
near everything or a little of it; but I&#8217;m
going to come call on all of you when I get my
wares sorted out.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Do! Do!&#8221; they responded, but she was in
and off before they could say more.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee, that&#8217;s a pretty girl!&#8221; exclaimed the
necktie drummer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon she is,&#8221; grunted Colonel Crutcher,
&#8220;pretty and good and sharp as a briar and
quick as greased lightning. There isn&#8217;t a girl
like her anywhere around these parts. I don&#8217;t
see what the young folks of the county are thinking
about, leaving her out of all their frolics.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you see&mdash;&#8221; put in another old man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I see the best-looking gal of the bunch
and the spunkiest and the equal of any of them
and the superior of most as far as manners and
brains are concerned, just because she comes of
plain folks&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A little worse than plain, Crutcher,&#8221; put in
Judge Middleton. &#8220;Those Bucks&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, then she lives at Buck Hill?&#8221; asked
the drummer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Buck Hill! Heavens man! The Bucknors
live at Buck Hill and are about the swellest folk
in Kentucky. The Bucks live in a little place
this side of Buck Hill. There&#8217;s nobody left but
this Judy gal and her mother. I reckon their
place would have gone for debt if it hadn&#8217;t so
happened that the trolley line from Louisville
cut through it and they sold the right of way
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
for enough to lift the mortgage. They do say
that the Bucknors and Bucks were the same
folks originally but that was in the early days
and somehow the Bucks got down and the Bucknors
staid up. Now the Bucknors would no
more acknowledge the relationship to the Bucks
than the Bucks would expect them to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should think anybody would be proud to
claim kin with a peach like that girl,&#8221; said Major
Fitch. &#8220;Her mother is a pretty good sort too,
but slow. I reckon when they get cousinly
inclined they always think of old Dick Buck,
Judy&#8217;s grandfather, who was enough to cool the
warmest feelings of kinship.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nodding assent to the Major&#8217;s remark, the
veterans lapsed into sleepy silence.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>Cousin Ann at Buck Hill</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Here comes Cousin Ann!&#8221; It was a wail
from the depth of Mildred Bucknor&#8217;s heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely not!&#8221; cried her mother. &#8220;There are
lots of other places for her to visit before our
turn comes again. There&#8217;s Uncle Tom&#8217;s and
Cousin Betty&#8217;s and Sister Sue&#8217;s, and Big Josh
and Little Josh haven&#8217;t had her for at least a
year. Are you sure, Mildred?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks like the old rockaway and Uncle
Billy&#8217;s top hat,&#8221; said Mildred. &#8220;It is too much
to bear just when we are going to have a house
party! Mother, please tell her it isn&#8217;t convenient
this June and have her go on to Big
Josh&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my dear, you know Father wouldn&#8217;t
hear of my doing that. Maybe it isn&#8217;t she after
all. Nan, climb up on the railing and see if
that could be Cousin Ann Peyton&#8217;s carriage
coming along the pike and turning into the
avenue.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, all I have to say is if it is her&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She,&#8221; corrected her mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;Her carriage. Wait until I finish my sentence,
Mother, before you correct me,&#8221; and the
girl climbed on the railing of the front porch
where the ladies of the Bucknor family were
wont to spend the summer mornings. Clinging
to one of the great fluted columns she tiptoed,
trying to peer through the cloud of limestone
dust that enveloped the approaching vehicle.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s her all right and I don&#8217;t care what kind
of grammar I use to express my disgust,&#8221; and
Nan jumped from the railing. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see
why&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, my dear, it can&#8217;t be helped. You
know how your father feels about his kin. Better
run and tell Aunt Em&#8217;ly to send Kizzie up
to get the guest chamber in order.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mother, you know it is in order. Nan
and I have been busy up there all morning getting
it ready for the girls. We&#8217;ve even got
flowers all fixed and clean bureau scarves and
everything,&#8221; said Mildred, trying not to weep.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and linen sheets. We thought you
wouldn&#8217;t mind, Mother, because you see Jean
Roland is used to such fine doings, and this is
her first visit to Kentucky. We know you have
only three pairs of linen sheets but this seemed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
the psychological time to use them. I&#8217;ve a great
mind to go yank them off the bed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Mother,&#8221; pleaded Mildred, &#8220;couldn&#8217;t
we put old Cousin Ann Peyton in the little hall
room? I can&#8217;t see why she always has to have
the guest chamber. She&#8217;s no better than anybody
else.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But your father&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What difference will it make to Father? He
needn&#8217;t even know where we put Cousin Ann.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think about it, Aunt Em&#8217;ly?&#8221;
Mrs. Bucknor asked the lean old colored woman
who appeared in the doorway. &#8220;Here comes
Miss Ann Peyton, and the young ladies want
to put her in the little hall bedroom because they
have planned to put their company in the guest
chamber?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Think! I think I&#8217;m a plum fool not ter
have wrang the neck er that ol&#8217; dominick rooster
yestiddy when he spent the whole day a crowin&#8217;
fer comp&#8217;ny. I pretty nigh knowed we were in
fer some kind er visitation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe he was crowing for our house party,&#8221;
suggested Nan.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, honey, that there rooster don&#8217;t never
crow for &#8217;vited comp&#8217;ny. Now if I had er wrang
his neck he&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; been in the pot, comp&#8217;ny or no,
an&#8217; it &#8217;ud cure him of any mo&#8217; reckless crowin&#8217;.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But, Aunt Em&#8217;ly, what do you think about
putting Miss Ann in the hall room?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Think! I think she&#8217;ll git her back up an&#8217;
that ol&#8217; Billy&#8217;ll be shootin&#8217; off his mouf, but we-all
done entertained Miss Ann an&#8217; ol&#8217; Billy an&#8217;
them ca&#8217;ige hosses goin&#8217; onter three months
already this year an&#8217; it&#8217;s high time some er the
res&#8217; of the fambly step up. What&#8217;s the matter
with Marse Big Josh? An&#8217; if he air onable
what&#8217;s the matter with Marse Lil Josh? Yassum,
put her in the hall room an&#8217; &#8217;fo&#8217; Gawd I&#8217;ll
make that ol&#8217; Billy keep his feet out&#8217;n the oven,
if not this summer, nex&#8217; winter. He&#8217;s the
orneris&#8217; nigger fer wantin&#8217; ter sit with his feet
in the oven.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, Mother, may we keep the guest chamber
for the girls? Please say yes!&#8221; begged Nan.
&#8220;Aunt Em&#8217;ly thinks it is all right and you know
you have always been telling us to mind Aunt
Em&#8217;ly because she has such good judgment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, my jedgment air that Miss Ann
oughter been occupewin&#8217; the hall room for some
fifty year or mo&#8217;, ever sence she an&#8217; that ol&#8217; Billy
took ter comin&#8217; so reg&#8217;lar,&#8221; said Aunt Em&#8217;ly.
&#8220;If I had it ter do over I&#8217;d never &#8217;a&#8217; let him
git so free with his feet in the oven. The truf
er the matter is, Miss Milly, that you an&#8217; Marse
Bob Bucknor an&#8217; all yo&#8217; chilluns as well, long
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
with all the res&#8217; of the fambly includin&#8217; of Marse
Big Josh an&#8217; Marse Lil Josh, done accepted of
Miss Ann Peyton an&#8217; ol&#8217; Billy an&#8217; the ca&#8217;ige
hosses like they wa&#8217; the will of the Almighty.
Well, now le&#8217;s see if Miss Ann Peyton can&#8217;t
accept the hall room like it wa&#8217; the will er the
Almighty an&#8217; if ol&#8217; Billy can&#8217;t come ter some
&#8217;clusion that Gawd air aginst his dryin&#8217; out his
ol&#8217; feet in my oven.&#8221;</p>
<p>While this discussion was going on, the cloud
of limestone dust had disappeared and from it
had emerged a quaint old coach, lumbering and
shabby, drawn by a pair of sleek sorrel horses,
whose teeth would have given evidence of
advanced age had a possible purchaser submitted
them to the indignity of examining them. Their
progress was slow and sedate, although the
driver handled the reins as though it were with
difficulty that he restrained them from prancing
and cavorting as they neared the mansion.</p>
<p>Old Billy&#8217;s every line, from his dented top hat
to his well-nigh soleless boots, expressed dignity
and superiority. He was quite sure that being
coachman to Miss Ann Peyton gave him the
right to wipe those worn boots on the rest of
mankind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at that ol&#8217; fool nigger!&#8221; exclaimed
Aunt Em&#8217;ly in disgust. &#8220;Settin&#8217; up there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
lookin&#8217; mo&#8217; like a monkey than a man in that
long-tail blue coat with brass buttons an&#8217; his ha&#8217;r
like cotton wool an&#8217; whiskers so long he haster
wrop &#8217;em. The onlies wuck that nigger ever
does is jes&#8217; growin&#8217; whiskers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, come now, Aunt Em&#8217;ly,&#8221; remonstrated
a young man who stepped from the study window
on the porch as the old coach lumbered up
the driveway, &#8220;Uncle Billy keeps his horses in
better condition than any on our farm are kept.
Poor old Uncle Billy!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor old Uncle Billy, indeed!&#8221; snapped
Mildred. &#8220;I reckon, Brother Jeff, you&#8217;d say
poor old Cousin Ann, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I would. I can&#8217;t think of any
person in the world I feel much sorrier for.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I can. I feel lots sorrier for Nan and
me with our house party on hand and Cousin
Ann turning up for the second time since Christmas.
It&#8217;s all well enough for you and Father
to be so high and mighty about honoring the
aged, and blood being thicker than water and
so on. You don&#8217;t have to sleep with Cousin
Ann, the way Nan and I do sometimes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We-ell, no!&#8221; laughed Jeff.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush, Mildred. Remember how Father
feels about the comings of Cousin Ann. You
and Nan must be polite.&#8221; Mrs. Bucknor sighed,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
realizing she was demanding of her daughters
something that was difficult for her to perform
herself. Being polite to Cousin Ann had been
the most arduous task imposed upon that wife
and mother during twenty-five years of married
life.</p>
<p>At the yard gate Uncle Billy drew in his
steeds with a great show of their being unwilling
to stop. He turned as though to command the
footman to alight and open the door of the
coach. With feigned astonishment at there being
no footman, he climbed down from the box
with so much dignity that even Aunt Em&#8217;ly
was impressed, though unwilling to acknowledge
it.</p>
<p>&#8220;That ol&#8217; nigger certainly do walk low for
anybody who sets so high,&#8221; she whispered to Mildred.
The bowing of Uncle Billy&#8217;s legs in truth
took many inches from his height. But the old
man, in spite of crooked legs, worn-out boots,
shabby livery and battered high hat, carried himself
with the air of a prime minister. Miss Ann
Peyton was his queen.</p>
<p>There was an expression of infinite pathos on
the countenance of the old darkey as he opened
the door of the ancient coach. Bowing low, as
though to royalty, he said, &#8220;Miss Ann, we air
done arrive.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span></p>
<p>Jeff Bucknor took his mother&#8217;s arm and
gently led her down the walk. Involuntarily
she stiffened under his affectionate grasp and
held back. It was all very well for the men
of the family to take the stand they did concerning
Cousin Ann Peyton and her oft-repeated
visits. Men had none of the bother of company.
Of course she would be courteous to her
and always treat her with the consideration due
an aged kinswoman, but she could not see the
use of pretending she was glad to see her and
rushing down the walk to meet her as though
she were an honored guest.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is hard on Mildred and Nan,&#8221; she murmured
to her stalwart son, as he escorted her
towards the battered coach.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Mother, but kin is kin&mdash;and the poor
old lady hasn&#8217;t any real home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well then she might&mdash;There are plenty of
them&mdash;very good comfortable ones&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean homes for old ladies? Oh,
Mother, you know Father would never consent
to that. Neither would Uncle Tom nor Big
Josh. She would hate it and then there&#8217;s Uncle
Billy and the horses&mdash;Cupid and Puck&mdash;to
say nothing of the chariot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Further discussion was impossible. Mother
and son reached the yard gate as Uncle Billy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
opened the coach door and announced the fact
that Miss Ann had arrived at her destination.
Then began the unpacking of the visitor. It
was a roomy carriage, and well that it was so.
When Miss Peyton traveled she traveled. Having
no home, everything she possessed must be
carried with her. Trunks were strapped on the
back of the coach and inside with the mistress
were boxes and baskets and bundles, suitcases
and two of those abominations known as telescopes,
from which articles of clothing were
bursting forth.</p>
<p>It was plain to see from the untidy packing
that Miss Ann and Uncle Billy had left their
last abode in a hurry. Even Miss Peyton&#8217;s
features might have been called untidy, if such
a term could be used in connection with a countenance
whose every line was aristocratic. As a
rule that lady was able so to control her emotions
that the uninitiated were ignorant of the fact
that she had emotions. She gave one the impression
on that morning in June of having packed
her emotions hurriedly, as she had her clothes,
and they were darting from her flashing eyes
as were garments from the telescopes.</p>
<p>Gently, almost as though he were performing
a religious rite, Uncle Billy lifted the shabby
baggage from the coach.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Let me help you, Uncle Billy. Good morning,
Cousin Ann. I am very glad to see you,&#8221;
said Jeff, although it was impossible to see
Cousin Ann until some of the luggage was
removed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, cousin.&#8221; Miss Ann spoke from
the depths of the coach. Her voice trembled a
little.</p>
<p>At last, every box, bag and bundle was removed
and piled by Uncle Billy upon each side
of the yard gate like a triumphal arch through
which his beloved mistress might pass.</p>
<p>Old Billy unfolded the steps of the coach.
These steps were supposed to drop at the opening
of the door but the spring had long ago lost
its power and the steps must be lowered by
hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mind whar you tread, Miss Ann,&#8221; he whispered.
Nobody must hear him suggest that the
steps were not safe. Nobody must ever know
that he and Miss Ann and the coach and horses
were getting old and played out.</p>
<p>Miss Ann had dignity enough to carry off
broken steps, shabby baggage, rickety carriage&mdash;anything.
She emerged from the coach with
the air of being visiting royalty conferring a
favor on her lowly subjects by stopping with
them. Her dignity even overtopped the fact
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
that her auburn wig was on crooked and a long
lock of snow-white hair had straggled from its
moorings and crept from the confines of the
purple quilted-satin poke bonnet. The beauty
which had been hers in her youth was still hers
although everybody could not see it. Uncle
Billy could see it and Jeff Bucknor glimpsed it,
as his old cousin stepped from her dingy coach.
He had never realized before that Cousin Ann
Peyton had lines and proportions that must
always be beautiful&mdash;a set of the head, a slope
of shoulder, a length of limb, a curve of wrist
and a turn of ankle. The old purple poke bonnet
might have been a diadem, so high did she
carry her head; and she floated along in the
midst of her voluminous skirts like a belle of
the sixties&mdash;which she had been and still was
in the eyes of her devoted old servant.</p>
<p>Miss Peyton wore hoop skirts. Where she
got them was often conjectured. Surely she
could not be wearing the same ones she had worn
in the sixties and everybody knew that the articles
were no longer manufactured. Big Josh
had declared on one occasion when some of the
relatives had waxed jocose on the subject of
Cousin Ann and her style of dress, that she had
bought a gross of hoop skirts cheap at the time
when they were going out of style and had them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
stored in his attic&mdash;but then everybody knew
that Big Josh would say anything that popped
into his head and then swear to it and Little
Josh would back him up.</p>
<p>&#8220;By heck, there&#8217;s no room in the attic for
trunks,&#8221; he had insisted. &#8220;Hoop skirts everywhere!
Boxes of &#8217;em! Barrels of &#8217;em! Hanging
from the rafters like Japanese lanterns!
Standing up in the corners like ghosts scaring
a fellow to death! I can&#8217;t keep servants at all
because of Cousin Ann Peyton&#8217;s buying that
gross of hoop skirts. Little Josh will bear me
out in this.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Little Josh would, although the truth of
the matter was that Cousin Ann had only one
hoop skirt, and it was the same she had worn
in the sixties. Inch by inch its body had been
renewed to reclaim it from the ravages of time
until not one iota of the original garment was
left. Here a tape and there a wire had been
carefully changed, but always the hoop kept its
original form. The spirit of the sixties still
breathed from it and it enveloped Miss Ann as
in olden days.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>Cousin Ann Is Affronted</h3>
</div>
<p>Mrs. Bucknor stood aside while Uncle Billy
and Jeff unpacked the carriage but as the visitor
emerged she came forward. &#8220;How do you
do, Cousin Ann?&#8221; she said, trying to put some
warmth in her remark. &#8220;Have you driven
far?&#8221;</p>
<p>Cousin Ann leaned over stiffly and gave her
hostess a perfunctory peck on her cheek. &#8220;We
left Cousin Betty Throckmorton&#8217;s this morning,&#8221;
she said with a toss of the purple poke
bonnet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you must have had a very early
breakfast.&#8221; It was a well-known fact that the
sorrel horses, although of the famous Golddust
breed, were old and could travel at a stretch only
about five miles an hour.</p>
<p>&#8220;We lef&#8217; Miss Betty&#8217;s befo&#8217; breakfas&#8217;,&#8221; said
Uncle Billy sadly, but a glance from his mistress
made him add, &#8220;but we ain&#8217;t hongry, case
we done et our fill at a hotel back yonder.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I deemed it wise to travel before the heat of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
the day,&#8221; said Miss Ann with an added dignity.
&#8220;Take my luggage to my room, Billy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yassum, yes, Miss Ann,&#8221; and the old man
made a show of tying his team to the hitching
post although he knew that the fat old Cupid
and Puck were glad to stop and rest and nothing
short of oats would budge them.</p>
<p>Mildred and Nan came slowly down the walk,
followed by Aunt Em&#8217;ly. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got to let
her kiss us and we might just as well get it over
with,&#8221; grumbled Mildred.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, they&#8217;s some compersations in bein&#8217;
black,&#8221; chuckled Aunt Em&#8217;ly. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t never
had ter kiss Miss Ann yit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you do, cousins?&#8221; and Miss Peyton
again stooped from her loftiness and pecked
first one girl and then the other. The old lady
called all of her young relations cousin without
adding the Christian name and it was generally
conceded that she did this because she could not
keep up with the younger generation in the
many homes she visited.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother, remember your promise,&#8221; whispered
Mildred.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Mother, remember,&#8221; added Nan.
&#8220;Now is the time, before the trunks and things
get put in the wrong room.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Billy, Miss Ann is to have the room
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
next the guest chamber. I mean the&mdash;hall
room,&#8221; hesitated poor Mrs. Bucknor, who was
always overawed by Cousin Ann.</p>
<p>Uncle Billy put down the two bulging telescopes
he had picked up and looking piteously
at Mrs. Bucknor said, &#8220;What you say, Miss
Milly? I reckon I done misumberstood. You
mus&#8217; &#8217;scuse ol&#8217; Billy, Miss Milly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Milly done said I&#8217;ll show you the way,&#8221;
said Aunt Em&#8217;ly, picking up a great hat box
and a Gladstone bag. &#8220;I&#8217;ll he&#8217;p you carry up
some er these here bags an&#8217; baggage.&#8221;</p>
<p>The gaunt old woman stalked ahead, while
Billy followed, but far from meekly. His beard
with its many wrapped plaits wagged ominously
and he could hardly wait to get beyond earshot
of the white folks before he gave voice to his
indignation.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s all this a puttin&#8217; my Miss Ann off
in a lil&#8217; ol&#8217; hall bedroom? You-alls is gone
kinder crazy. The bes&#8217; ain&#8217;t good enough fer
my Miss Ann. How she gonter make out in
no little squz up room what ain&#8217;t mo&#8217;n a dressin&#8217;-room?
Miss Ann air always been a havin&#8217; the
gues&#8217; chamber an&#8217; I&#8217;m a gonter &#8217;stablish her thar
now. Miss Milly done got mixed up, Sis
Em&#8217;ly,&#8221; and the old man changed his indignant
tone to a wheedling one. &#8220;Sholy yo&#8217; Miss Milly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
wa&#8217; jes&#8217; a foolin&#8217; an&#8217; seein&#8217; as th&#8217;ain&#8217;t nobody in
the gues&#8217; chamber we&#8217;ll jes&#8217; put my Miss Ann
thar.&#8221;</p>
<p>The door of the guest chamber was open and
the determined old darkey pushed by Aunt
Em&#8217;ly and entered the room prepared by Mildred
and Nan for their friends.</p>
<p>&#8220;See, they mus&#8217; a&#8217; got a message she wa&#8217; on
the way, kase they done put flowers in her room
an&#8217; all,&#8221; and old Billy kneeled to loosen the
straps of the telescopes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Git up from yonder, nigger!&#8221; exclaimed
Aunt Em&#8217;ly. &#8220;The young ladies air done swep
and garnished this here room for they own
comp&#8217;ny. Th&#8217;ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; the matter with that
there hall room. It air plenty good enough fer
mos&#8217; folks. I reckon yo&#8217; Miss Ann ain&#8217;t a whit
better&#8217;n my Miss Mildred and my Miss Nan&mdash;ain&#8217;t
so good in fac&#8217;, kase they&#8217;s got the same
blood she air an&#8217; mo&#8217; of it. They&#8217;s a older
fambly than she is kase they&#8217;s come along two
or three generations further than what she is.
They&#8217;s Peytons an&#8217; Bucknors an&#8217; Prestons an&#8217;
Throckmortons an&#8217; Butlers an&#8217;&mdash;an&#8217; every
other Kentucky fambly they&#8217;s a mind ter be.&#8221;</p>
<p>Uncle Billy staggered to his feet and looked
at Aunt Em&#8217;ly with amazement and indignation.
He tried to speak but words failed him. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
towered above him. There was something sinister
and threatening about her&mdash;at least so the
old man fancied. Aunt Em&#8217;ly was in reality
merely standing up for the rights of her own
especial white folks, but to the dazed old man
she seemed like a symbolic figure of famine and
disaster, lean and gaunt, pointing a long, bony
finger at him. He followed her to the hall bedroom
and deposited his burdens and then staggered
down the stairs for the rest of Miss Ann&#8217;s
belongings.</p>
<p>Poor Uncle Billy! His troubles were almost
more than he could bear. Not that he personally
minded getting up before dawn and flitting
from Mrs. Betty Throckmorton&#8217;s home before
any member of the household was stirring. His
Miss Ann had so willed it and far be it from
him to object to her commands. Even going
without breakfast was no hardship, if it so
pleased his beloved mistress. The meal he had
declared to Mrs. Bucknor they had eaten at a
hotel on the way was purely imaginary. Crackers
and cheese from a country store they had
passed on their journey and a spray of black-heart
cherries he had pulled from a tree by the
wayside was all he and his mistress had eaten
since the evening before at supper.</p>
<p>That supper! Would he ever forget it? From
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
the back porch steps he had heard the insults
flung at Miss Ann by her hostess. Of course
everybody who was anybody, or who had ever
belonged to anybody, knew that Mrs. Elizabeth
Throckmorton, known as Cousin Betty, was not
really a member of the family but had merely
married into it. According to Uncle Billy&#8217;s
geography she was not even an American, let
alone a Kentuckian, since she had come from
some foreign parts vaguely spoken of as New
England. He and Miss Ann never had liked
to visit there, but stopped on rare occasions when
they felt that being an outsider her feelings
might be hurt when she heard they had been in
her neighborhood, had passed by her farm without
paying their respects in the shape of a short
visit.</p>
<p>The encounter between the two ladies had
been short and sharp, while the Throckmorton
family sat in frightened silence. Miss Ann and
Uncle Billy had been there only two days but
from the beginning of the visit Uncle Billy had
felt that things were not going so smoothly as
he had hoped. Things had not been running
very well for the chronic visitors in several of the
places visited during the last year but there had
been no open break or rudeness until that evening
at the Throckmortons&#8217;. It was a little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
unfortunate that they had come in on the family
without warning, just as the oldest grandchildren
were recovering from measles and the
youngest daughter, Lucy, had made up her mind
to have a June wedding. The measles had necessitated
an extra house cleaning and fumigation
of the nursery and the young sufferers had been
put in the guest chamber to sleep, while the June
wedding meant many visits to Louisville for
trousseau and much conversation on the subject
of who should not be invited and what kind
of refreshments must be served.</p>
<p>A more unpropitious moment for paying a
visit could not have been chosen. It was plain
to see that the Throckmortons were not aware of
the honor conferred upon them. The guest
chamber having been converted into a convalescent
hospital, Miss Ann must share room and bed
with the reluctant Lucy. Bureau drawers were
cleared and part of a wardrobe dedicated to the
aged relative. Moreover there was no room in
the stable for the visiting carriage horses, as a
young Throckmorton had recently purchased a
string of valuable hunters that must be housed,
although Miss Ann&#8217;s Golddust breed were forced
to present their broad backs to the rain and wind
in the pasture.</p>
<p>Old Billy slept in the coach, but he often did
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
this in late years&mdash;how often he never let his
mistress know. In early days he had been welcomed
by the servants and treated with the
respect due Miss Ann Peyton&#8217;s coachman, but
the older generation of colored people had died
off or had become too aged and feeble to &#8220;make
the young folks stand around.&#8221; As for the
white people, Uncle Billy couldn&#8217;t make up his
mind what was the matter with them. Wasn&#8217;t
Miss Ann the same Miss Ann who had been
visiting ever since her own beautiful home, Peyton,
had been burned to the ground just after
the war? She was on a visit at the time. Billy
was coachman and had driven her to Buck Hill.
He wasn&#8217;t old Billy then, but was young and
sprightly. He drove a spanking pair of sorrels
and the coach was new and shiny. It was indeed
a stylish turnout and Miss Ann Peyton was
known as the belle and beauty of Kentucky.</p>
<p>It was considered very fortunate at the time
of the fire that Ann was visiting and had all of
her clothes and jewels with her. They at least
were saved. From Buck Hill they had gone to
the home of other relations and so on until visiting
became a habit. Her father, a widower, died
a few weeks after the fire and later her brother.
The estate had dwindled until only a small
income was inherited by the bereaved Ann.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
Visiting was cheap. She was made welcome by
the relations, and on prosperous blue-grass farms
the care of an extra pair of carriage horses and
the keep of another servant made very little
difference. Cousin Ann, horses and coachman,
were received with open arms and urged to stop
as long as they cared to.</p>
<p>In those days there always seemed to be plenty
of room for visitors. The houses were certainly
no larger than of the present day but they were
more elastic. Of course entertaining a handsome
young woman of lively and engaging manners,
whose beaux were legion, was very different
from having a peculiar old lady in a hoop
skirt descend upon you unawares from a shabby
coach drawn by fat old horses that looked as
though they might not go another step in spite
of the commands of the grotesque coachman with
his plaited beard and bushy white hair.</p>
<p>But that supper at the Throckmortons&#8217;! Uncle
Billy was seated on the porch steps with a pan
of drippings in his hand, wherein the cook had
grudgingly put the scrag of a fried chicken and
a hunk of cold corn bread. The cook was a new
cook and not at all inclined to bother herself over
an old darkey with his whiskers done up in plaits.
The old man silently sopped his bread and
listened to the talk of the white folks indoors.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Cousin Ann, have you ever thought of going
to a home for aged women?&#8221; Mrs. Throckmorton
asked. Her tone was brisk and businesslike,
though not unkind. Mrs. Throckmorton
had been entertaining this old cousin of her
husband for many years and while she was not
honored with as many visits as some of the relations
she was sure she had her full share. It
seemed to her high time that some member or
near member of the family should step in and
suggest to the old lady that there were such
homes and that she should enter one.</p>
<p>&#8220;I? Ann Peyton go to an old ladies&#8217; home?
Cousin Betty you must be in a jocular vein,&#8221;
and Uncle Billy saw through the open door that
his mistress drew herself up like a queen and
her eyes flashed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, plenty of persons quite as good as you
go to such homes every day,&#8221; insisted the hostess.
&#8220;I should think you would prefer having a regular
home and not driving from pillar to post,
never knowing where you will land next and
never sure whether your relations will have room
for you or not. As it is, just now I am really
afraid it will not be convenient for you to stay
much longer with us. What with Lucy&#8217;s wedding
and the measles and everything! Of course
you need not go immediately&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That is enough, Cousin Betty. Never shall
it be said that we have worn out our welcome.
We go immediately.&#8221; Miss Ann&#8217;s voice was
loud and clear. She stood up and pushed back
her chair sharply. &#8220;We beg to be excused,&#8221; she
said and turned to walk from the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, nonsense, Cousin Ann!&#8221; exclaimed Mrs.
Throckmorton impatiently. &#8220;Nobody said you
must go immediately. It was just with the wedding
imminent and&mdash;anyhow I meant it for the
best when I mentioned a home for aged women.
You would be quite comfortable in one and I
am sure I could find exactly the right sort. You
would have to make a deposit of several thousands&mdash;I
don&#8217;t know exactly how much but you
must have a little something left since you pay
old Billy&#8217;s wages and have your horses shod and
so on. Of course in the home you would have
no such expenses. You could sell your horses
and your old coach is little more than junk, and
old Billy could go to a home too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Ann had paused a moment but when
Mrs. Throckmorton spoke of her carriage as
junk and suggested a home for Billy, too, her
indignation knew no bounds and with a commanding
gesture of dismissal she stalked from
the dining-room. Billy was summoned and since
it was out of the question to start so late in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
evening it was determined that daylight should
find them on their way to Buck Hill&mdash;Buck
Hill where a certain flavor of old times was still
to be found, with Cousin Bob Bucknor, so like
his father, who had been one of the swains who
followed in the train of the beautiful Ann Peyton.
Buck Hill would always make her welcome!</p>
<p>And now&mdash;Buck Hill&mdash;and a hall bedroom!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>The Energy of Judith</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Mother, Cousin Ann Peyton is at Buck Hill.
I saw her old carriage on the road when I went
in for my express parcels.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why will you insist upon saying Cousin
Ann, Judith?&#8221; drawled Mrs. Buck. &#8220;I&#8217;d take
my time about calling anybody cousin who
scorned to do the same by me.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Judith&#8217;s mother took her time about everything,
the girl smiled indulgently, and proceeded
in the unpacking of the express packages.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad I am selling for this company
that sends all goods directly to me instead of
having me take orders the way the other one
did. I&#8217;m just a born peddler and I know I
make more when I can deliver the goods the
minute they are bought and paid for. I&#8217;m going
to take Buck Hill in on my rounds this year
and see if all of my dear cousins won&#8217;t lay in a
stock of sweet soap and cold cream.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There you are, calling those Buck Hill folks
cousin again. Here child, don&#8217;t waste that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
string. I can&#8217;t see what makes you so wasteful.
You should untie each package, carefully pick
out the knots, and then roll it up in a ball. I
wonder how many times I&#8217;ve told you that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So do I, Mother, and how many times I
have told you that my time is too precious to be
picking out hard knots. I bet this minute you&#8217;ve
got a ball of string as big as your head, and
please tell me how many packages you send out
in a year.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s manner was gay and bantering.
She stopped untying parcels long enough to kiss
her mother, who was laboriously picking the
knots from the cut twine.</p>
<p>Mrs. Buck continued, &#8220;Wasting all of that
good paper too! Here, let me fold it up. My
mother and father taught me to be very particular
about such things and goodness knows
I&#8217;ve tried to teach you. I don&#8217;t know where we&#8217;d
be if I didn&#8217;t save and if my folks before me
hadn&#8217;t done so.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a well-known fact that Judith&#8217;s maternal
grandparents, Mr. and Mrs. Ezra Knight,
had been forced to abandon their ancestral farm
in Connecticut and had started to California on
a hazard of new fortunes but had fallen by the
wayside, landing in Kentucky where their habits
of saving string and paper certainly had not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
enriched them. Such being the case a whimsical
smile from the granddaughter was pardonable.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no telling,&#8221; she laughed, &#8220;but you
go on saving, Mother dear, and I&#8217;ll try to do
some making and between us we&#8217;ll be as rich as
our cousins at Buck Hill.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There you are again! I&#8217;d feel ashamed to
go claiming relations with folks that didn&#8217;t even
know I existed. I can&#8217;t see what makes you
do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, just for fun! You see we really and
truly are kin. We are just as close kin as some
of the people Cousin Ann Peyton visits, because
you see she takes in anybody and everybody
from the third and fourth generation of them
that hate to see her coming. Yesterday in
Louisville I looked up the family in some old
books on the early history of Kentucky at the
Carnegie Library and I found out a lot of
things. In the first place the Bucks weren&#8217;t
named for Buck Hill.&#8221;</p>
<p>The land owned by Mrs. Buck had at one
time been as rich as any in Kentucky, but it had
been overworked until it was almost as poor as
the deserted farm in Connecticut. As Judge
Middleton had said, the price of the right-of-way
through the place sought by the trolley
company had enabled her to lift the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
long-standing mortgage. She had inherited the farm,
mortgage and all, from her father, who had
bought it from old Dick Buck. The house was
a pleasant cottage of New England architecture,
built closer to the road than is usual on
Kentucky farms. Old Mr. Knight had also followed
the traditions of his native state by building
his barn with doors opening on the road.
The barn was larger than the house, but at the
present time Judith&#8217;s little blue car and an old
red cow were its sole inhabitants. The hay loft,
which was designed to hold many tons of hay,
was empty. Sometimes an errant hen would
find her way up there and start a nest in vain
hopes of being allowed to lay her quota and
begin the business of hatching her own offspring
in her own way, but Judith would rout her out
and force her to comply to community housekeeping
in the poultry-house.</p>
<p>The Knights&#8217; motto might have been: &#8220;Lazy
Faire&#8221; and the Buck&#8217;s &#8220;&#8217;Nuff Said,&#8221; as a wag
at Ryeville had declared, but such mottoes did
not fit Miss Judith. Nothing must be left as
it was unless it was already exactly right and
enough was not said until she had spoken her
mind freely and fearlessly. Everything about
this girl was free and fearless&mdash;her walk, the
way she held her head, her unflinching hazel
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
eyes and ready, ringing laugh. Even her red
gold hair demanded freedom and refused to stay
confined in coil, braid or net.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t know where you came
from,&#8221; Mrs. Buck drawled. &#8220;You&#8217;re so energetic
and wasteful like. Of course my folks
were never ones to sit still and be taken care
of like the Bucks,&#8221; and then her mild eyes would
snap a bit, &#8220;but the Knights believed in saving.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Even energy?&#8221; asked Judith saucily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, there isn&#8217;t any use in wasting even
energy. My father used to say that saving was
the keynote of life as well as religion. I reckon
you must be a throw back to my mother&#8217;s
grandfather, who was a Norse sailor, and reckless
and wasteful and red-headed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe so! At any rate I&#8217;m going to plough
some guano into these acres, even though I can&#8217;t
plough the seas like my worthy grandpap, Sven
Thorwald Woden, or whatever his name was.
Just look at our wheat, Mother! It isn&#8217;t fit to
feed chickens with because our land is so poor.
I&#8217;m tired of this eternal saving and no making.
There is no reason why our yield shouldn&#8217;t be
as great per acre as Buck Hill, but we don&#8217;t
get half as much as they do. I&#8217;ve got to make
a lot of money this summer so as to buy bags
and bags of fertilizer. I&#8217;ve got a new scheme.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be bound you have,&#8221; sighed Mrs. Buck.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;ll have to help me by making cakes
and pies and things and peeling potatoes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, just so you don&#8217;t hurry me!
I can&#8217;t be hurried.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What a nice mother you are to say all right
without even asking what it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There wasn&#8217;t any use in wasting my breath
asking, because I knew you&#8217;d tell me without
asking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, this is it: I&#8217;m going to feed the motormen
and conductors. I got the idea yesterday
when I was coming up from Louisville by trolley,
when I saw the poor fellows eating such
miserable lunches out of tin buckets with everything
hot that ought to be cold and cold that
ought to be hot. I heard them talking about
it and complaining and the notion struck me. I
went up and sat by the men and asked them
how they would like to have a supper handed
them every evening, because it seems it is the
night meal they miss most, and they nearly
threw a fit with joy. I&#8217;m to begin this very
day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Buck threw up her hands in despair.
&#8220;Judy, you just shan&#8217;t do any such thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Mother, honey, you said you&#8217;d help
and the men are not bringing any supper from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
home and you surely wouldn&#8217;t have them go
hungry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you said I would not have to hurry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And neither will you. You can take your
own time and I&#8217;ll do the hurrying. I only
have two suppers to hand out this evening, but
I bet you in a week I&#8217;ll be feeding a dozen
men and they&#8217;ll like it and pay me well and
before you know it we&#8217;ll be rich and we can have
lots better food ourselves and even keep a
servant.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A servant! Heavens, Judith, not a wasteful
servant!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No indeed, Mother, a saving one&mdash;one who
will save us many steps and give me time to
make more money than you can save. I&#8217;ll
give them fried chicken this evening and hashed
brown potatoes and hot rolls and plum jam and
buttermilk. The radishes are up and big enough
to eat and so are the young onions. All conductors
eat onions. They do it to keep people
from standing on the back platform. I am
certainly glad the line came through our place
and we have a stop so near us. I&#8217;ll have to
order a dozen baskets with nice, neat covers and
big enough to hold plates and cups and saucers.
Thank goodness we have enough china to go
around what with the Buck leavings and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
Knight savings. I&#8217;m going to get some five
and ten cent store silver and a great gross of
paper napkins. I tell you, Mother, I&#8217;m going
to do this up in style.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Buck groaned out something about waste
and sadly began paring potatoes, although it
was then quite early in the forenoon and the
trolleymen&#8217;s supper was not to be served until
six-thirty.</p>
<p>&#8220;That child&#8217;ll wear herself out,&#8221; she said,
not to herself but to an old blue hen who was
scratching around the hollyhocks, clucking
loudly. The hen had a motherly air, having
launched so many families, and Mrs. Buck felt
instinctively she might sympathize with her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank goodness I ain&#8217;t got but one to
worry about,&#8221; she continued as the repeated
clucks brought Old Blue&#8217;s brood around her.
&#8220;Now just look at that poor old hen! I wonder
if she&#8217;d rather be a hen and have so many
large families to raise or if she wishes she&#8217;d
been a rooster and maybe been fried in her
youth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Deep thinking was too much for Mrs. Buck.
She stopped peeling potatoes and fell into a
brown study. The side porch was a pleasant
place to sit and dream. Judith had sorted out
her wares and stored them in the back of her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
blue car. She had caught two chickens and
dressed them and set a sponge for the hot
rolls. She had promised herself the pleasure
of serving the motorman and conductor a trial
supper whose excellence she was sure would
bring in dozens of orders.</p>
<p>A whirr from the barn and in a moment
Judith was off and away, leaving a cloud of
dust behind her.</p>
<p>&#8220;No hurry about the potatoes!&#8221; she called
as she passed the house, and then her voice
trailed off with, &#8220;I&#8217;ll be back by and by.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just like the old woman on a broomstick
in Mother Goose,&#8221; Mrs. Buck informed the hen
and then since there was no hurry about the
potatoes she fell to dreaming again. It was
very peaceful on the shady porch with that
whirlwind of a Judy gone for several hours on
one of her crazy peddling jaunts. What a girl
she was for plunging! Again the mother wondered
where she came from and for the ten
thousandth time agreed with herself that it
must be the blood of the Norse sailor cropping
out in her energetic daughter.</p>
<p>&#8220;It might have been the Bucks way back
yonder somewhere. Certainly she didn&#8217;t get
any up-and-doing from old Dick Buck or my
poor husband.&#8221; Mrs. Buck always thought and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
spoke of her husband as her poor husband.
That was because he had died in the first year
of their marriage. Perhaps a merciful Providence
had taken him off before he had time
to develop to any great extent the traits that
made his father, old Dick Buck, a by-word in
the county as being the laziest and most altogether
no-account white man in Kentucky.</p>
<p>Her thoughts drifted back to her childhood
in New England. She could barely remember
the old white farmhouse with its faded green
shutters that rattled so dismally in the piercing
winds that seemed to single out the Knight
house as it swept down between the hills. She
recalled vividly the discussion carried on between
her parents in regard to their mode of
moving West&mdash;whether by wagon or rail&mdash;and
the final decision to go by wagon because
in that way they might save not only railroad
fare but the bony team. Furniture was packed
ready for shipment and stored in a neighbor&#8217;s
barn until they were sure in just what part
of the West they would settle. California had
been their goal, but Kentucky seemed far
enough. They had stopped for a while in Ryeville
with an old neighbor from New England
and, hearing of a farm owned by one Dick
Buck that was to be sold for taxes, they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
determined to abandon the journey to California
and put what savings they had on this farm.</p>
<p>The mortgage went with the farm. That
Ezra Knight bargained for, but what he had
not bargained for was that old Dick Buck and
his son, young Dick, also were included in the
purchase. They lived in a two-room log house,
a little behind the site Ezra had selected for his
own domicile. This was the natural place to
build, since the land sloped gently from it,
giving a proper drainage, and then the well was
already there and a wonderfully good well it
was.</p>
<p>The new house was built, the plan following
the old house they had left in Connecticut as
closely as possible, but still old Dick Buck stayed
on in his log cabin. Every day he told Ezra
Knight he was planning to move, but always
some unforeseen event would arise to make it
necessary for him to postpone his departure.
The houses were not fifty feet apart, the back
yard of the New England cottage serving as a
front yard to the cabin. The days stretched
into weeks, the weeks into months. Ezra grew
impatient and the old Dick took to his bed with
a mysterious malady that defied the skill of
the country doctor. Mrs. Knight, a kindly soul,
ministered to his wants, saying she couldn&#8217;t let
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
a dog suffer if he was a neighbor. The months
stretched into years. Every time Ezra approached
the one time owner of the farm on
the subject of his finding some other place of
abode, old Dick had an attack of his mysterious
malady and Ezra would have to give up for
the time being.</p>
<p>In the meantime young Dick was growing
into a likely lad and little Prudence Knight
had let down her skirts and put up her hair.
Dick was employed on the Knight farm, and
what was more natural than he should take his
meals with them? Old Dick found it equally
natural that he should also make one at the
frugal board. When Ezra died, which he did
ten years after he moved to Kentucky, old Dick
and young Dick kindly offered to sit up with
the corpse. The bereaved wife made the bed
in the low-ceilinged attic room for them and
what more natural than they should stay on?
Stay on they did until young Dick and Prudence
were married; until young Dick died.
Then old Dick stayed on and Mrs. Knight died
and his daughter-in-law and the little flame-haired
Judith were left to fend for themselves.</p>
<p>After the death of Mrs. Knight of course
leaving was impossible. Old Dick even spoke
of himself as the sole support of his daughter-in-law
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
and her little Judith. He began to look
upon hunting and fishing as a duty and seemed
to feel that they would have been destitute without
his occasional donation of a small string of
perch or a rabbit. Mrs. Knight tolerated him
because she was used to him. Judith had a real
affection for the old man and, when he died,
mourned for him sincerely. To be sure he had
been a very untidy old person who had never
done a day&#8217;s work in all his life but at least he
had a nimble wit which had appealed to the
child.</p>
<p>After his death Judith trapped rabbits and
caught fish. She did many things besides, however,
as by that time family funds were so low
and the farm so unproductive it was necessary
for some member of the family to begin to make
money. She was fourteen at the time her grandfather
died&mdash;a slim long-legged girl giving
promise of the beauty that the old soldiers and
the drummer on the Rye House porch acknowledged
later on. Even then the wire-spring
energy was hers that still puzzled her mother&mdash;energy
and an ever-present determination to get
ahead. Sometimes she caught enough fish to sell
a few. Sometimes she carried rabbits into the
town for sale. In blackberry season she was
an indefatigable picker. She went in for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
chickens and had steady customers in Louisville
for her guaranteed eggs. School was looked
upon as part of the business of getting ahead.
Nothing in the way of weather daunted her.
She went through the high school with flying
colors and got a medal for not having missed a
single day in four years.</p>
<p>At nineteen she was teaching school for eight
months of the year and the other four peddling
toilet articles and a few side lines and now planning
to feed the motormen on the interurban
trolleys.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well! I guess she got it from the
Norse sailor,&#8221; sighed Mrs. Buck picking up
another potato.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>Uncle Billy&#8217;s Diplomacy</h3>
</div>
<p>The hall bedroom at Buck Hill was not such
a small room, except in comparison with the
other rooms, which were enormous. There was
plenty of space in it for Miss Ann and a reasonable
amount of luggage, but not for Miss Ann
and three trunks and the numerous bags and
bundles and boxes, which Billy stowed away,
endeavoring to make the place as comfortable
as possible for his beloved mistress.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll unstrop yo&#8217; trunks an&#8217; we kin git
unpacked an&#8217; then I&#8217;ll tote the empties up in
the attic &#8217;ginst the time we &#8217;cides ter move on,&#8221;
he said, looking sadly at Miss Ann as she sank
listlessly in a chair. Miss Ann allowed herself
to be listless in the presence of Billy, and Billy
alone. At the sound of a step on the stairs she
stiffened involuntarily. Nobody must find Ann
Peyton slouching or down-hearted. It was only
Mildred going up for a last look at the guest
chamber, to make sure everything was in readiness
for her company. She did not come to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
her old cousin&#8217;s room so Miss Ann felt at liberty
to relax once more.</p>
<p>&#8220;Billy, I am not going to unpack yet,&#8221; she
faltered. &#8220;I&mdash;I&mdash;perhaps we may have to
start off again in a hurry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say it, Miss Ann! We won&#8217;t never
be called on ter depart from Buck Hill &#8217;til we&#8217;s
good an&#8217; ready&mdash;not whilst Marse Bob Bucknor&#8217;s
prodigy is livin&#8217;, an&#8217; Mr. Jeff the spitin&#8217;
image of his gran&#8217;dad. I&#8217;s sho Miss Milly done
put you in this pretty lil&#8217; room kase she thought
you&#8217;d like it, bein&#8217; so handy to the stairs an&#8217; all,
an&#8217; the windy right over the baid so&#8217;s you kin
lay an &#8217;look out at the trees an&#8217; flowers&mdash;an&#8217; if
there ain&#8217;t a wishteria vine a comin&#8217; in the casement
an&#8217; twinin&#8217; aroun&#8217; jes&#8217; like a pixture. I
tell you Miss Ann, this here room becomes you
powerful much. I wonder they ain&#8217;t never give
it ter you befo&#8217;. It&#8217;s a heap mo&#8217; homey like
than the gues&#8217; chamber an&#8217; I&#8217;m thinkin&#8217; it&#8217;s
agonter be quieter an&#8217; cooler an&#8217; much mo&#8217; habitationable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Billy, I&#8217;m sure it will be.&#8221; There was
a plaintive suggestion of tears in her voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Miss Ann, you git in yo&#8217; wropper an&#8217;
lay down a spell an&#8217; I&#8217;m gonter fotch you a cup
er tea. You&#8217;s plum tuckered out what with sech
a early start an&#8217; mo&#8217;n likely no sleep las&#8217; night.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
You ain&#8217;t called on ter be a botherin&#8217; yo&#8217; little
haid &#8217;bout nothin&#8217;. Jes&#8217; you res&#8217; yo&#8217;se&#8217;f an&#8217; after
you rests you kin come down on the po&#8217;ch an&#8217;
git the air.&#8221;</p>
<p>If he had been a mammy coaxing a child
Billy&#8217;s tone could not have been more gentle
or loving. He busied himself unstrapping the
trunks and valises and then hurried off for the
cup of tea, declaring he would be back in a
moment although he well knew that a trial of
will with Aunt Em&#8217;ly lay before him. Tea and
toast he determined to have for his mistress&mdash;if
over the cook&#8217;s dead body. Aunt Em&#8217;ly was
queen of the kitchen and nothing irritated her
more than having extra food to prepare.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let &#8217;em eat they victuals when they&#8217;s served,
three times a day without no stint or savin&#8217; an&#8217;
not be peckin&#8217; in between times,&#8221; she hurled at
poor old Billy when he meekly demanded a tray
for the hall bedroom.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll fix it myself, Sis Em&#8217;ly, an&#8217; I won&#8217;t
make a mite er dirt. Miss Ann air plum flabbergasted
what with sech a long trip an&#8217; no
breakfas&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you done boas&#8217; you et at a hotel,&#8221;
sniffed the old woman. &#8220;How come she air
hongry fer tea an&#8217; toas&#8217; if she done et at a hotel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sho&mdash;sho&mdash;but you see it done got jolted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
down an&#8217; Miss Ann&mdash;Please, Sis Em&#8217;ly. I
ain&#8217;t a arskin&#8217; nothin&#8217; fer myse&#8217;f, but jes&#8217; for my
Miss Ann. You done won out consarnin&#8217; gues&#8217;
chambers an&#8217; hall bedrooms so you mought be
willin&#8217; ter give a po&#8217; tired lady a cup er tea.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aunt Em&#8217;ly was really a very kind person,
but there was something about old Billy&#8217;s long
beard tied up in innumerable plaits, his bow
legs and general air of superiority, that had
always irritated her. For years she had been
held in the subjection of politeness by this unwelcome
guest by the attitude of her white
people to his mistress, but now the barriers were
down and Mrs. Bucknor had openly expressed
her impatience at this too-frequent visitor and
had been persuaded by her daughters to give
Miss Ann the hall room, no longer need she
assume cordiality to the old servant. Of course
she intended to make the tea for Miss Ann but
she also intended to be as disagreeable as possible
while the kettle boiled.</p>
<p>The old man sat meekly in the corner of the
kitchen, watching Aunt Em&#8217;ly while she scalded
the small Rebecca pot and measured out the
tea. He was glad to see that she put in an extra
spoonful as that meant that he too might find
some much-needed refreshment. She made quite
a stack of toast and buttered it generously,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
although all the time she grumbled and frowned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, take it, an&#8217; git out&#8217;n my kitchen. I
don&#8217;t much mo&#8217;n git the breakfus dishes washed
befo&#8217; I haster begin gittin&#8217; dinner an&#8217; if I&#8217;s
gonter have ter be a stoppin&#8217; every five minutes
ter fix trays I like ter know when I will git
through.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Sis Em&#8217;ly, thank you!&#8221; cried
old Billy, seizing the coveted tray and making a
hasty exit. &#8220;Her bark air wus&#8217;n her bite,&#8221; he
chuckled, &#8220;an&#8217; I do hope Miss Ann ain&#8217;t gonter
take away her appletite for dinner by eatin&#8217; all
this toas&#8217; an&#8217; drinkin&#8217; this whole pot er tea, kase
I tell you now ol&#8217; Billy&#8217;s stomic air done stuck
to his back with emptiness.&#8221;</p>
<p>The tea and toast did put heart in the weary
travelers. Miss Ann left half the simple feast
for Billy, commanding him to go sit in the
corner of the room and devour his share.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I&#8217;m gonter rub down my hosses an&#8217;
wash the ca&#8217;ige, and if you&#8217;s got any little odd
jobs fer me ter do I&#8217;ll mosey back this way
arter dinner. Praise Gawd, the Buck Hill
folks has dinner in the middle of the day, an&#8217;
plenty of it. These here pick-up, mid-day
canned salmon lunches air bad enough for the
white folks but by the time they gits ter the
niggers th&#8217;ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; lef but the can. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
hear tell the young ladies air &#8217;spectin&#8217; of
comp&#8217;ny so I reckon you&#8217;ll be a needin&#8217; yo&#8217;
sprigged muslin ter take the shine out&#8217;n all
the gatherin&#8217;. I&#8217;m a gonter press it fer you,
even if a hot iron air arskin&#8217; a big favor with
some er these free niggers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Billy, you needn&#8217;t bother to press my
gown. It makes very little difference what I
wear. I don&#8217;t believe I can appear this
evening.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Ann, air you sick? Ain&#8217;t yo&#8217; tea picked
you up none?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Billy, I&#8217;m not sick. I&#8217;m just so miserable.
I&#8217;m beginning to see that we are no
longer wanted&mdash;even here at Buck Hill.&#8221; The
old woman&#8217;s voice quavered piteously. &#8220;They
used to want us&mdash;everywhere. At least, if
they didn&#8217;t they pretended they did. I don&#8217;t
know when it started&mdash;this drawing back&mdash;this
feeling we are a burden. When did it begin,
Billy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t never begun. You&#8217;s jes&#8217; so blue-blooded
you is sensitive like, Miss Ann. You
is wanted mo&#8217;n ever. You-all&#8217;s kin is proud
ter own you. You air still the beauty of the
fambly, Miss Ann. I knows, kase I done seed
every shemale mimber of the race er Peytons
an&#8217; Bucknors an&#8217; all. Th&#8217;ain&#8217;t never a one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
what kin hol&#8217; a can&#8217;le ter you. Don&#8217;t you go
ter throwin&#8217; off on my Miss Ann or you&#8217;ll
be havin&#8217; ol&#8217; Billy ter fight. I ain&#8217;t seed
nothin&#8217; in this county ter put long side er you,
less&#8217;n it wa&#8217; that pretty red-headed gal what
went whizzin&#8217; by us up yonder on the pike
in a blue ortermobubble. I ain&#8217;t knowin&#8217; who
she air but one thing that made her so pretty
wa&#8217; that I member the time when you wa&#8217; jes&#8217;
like her. She turned her head aroun&#8217; ter look
at us an&#8217; she give me sech a start I pretty
nigh fell off&#8217;n my box.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t meanin&#8217; no disrespec&#8217; ter Marse Bob
an&#8217; Miss Milly&#8217;s daughters, but they ain&#8217;t
nothin&#8217; by the side er that there young gal
what dusted us this mornin&#8217;. The bes&#8217;-lookin&#8217;
one er their daughters is Mr. Jeff. He air sho
growed ter a likely young man. He air certainly
kind an&#8217; politeful too. Didn&#8217;t he say
pintedly he wa&#8217; glad ter see you? Didn&#8217;t he
ketch a holt an&#8217; help me tote ev&#8217;y las&#8217; one er
these here trunks up here? When the young
marster air so hospitle I don&#8217;t see whe&#8217;fo&#8217; you
gits notions in yo&#8217; haid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you are right, Billy,&#8221; and Miss
Ann again held up her head. She must not
let herself slump. The will that had carried
her through all the long years of visiting must
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
carry her still. She had demanded and hence
received homage and respect from her kinsmen
for two generations and she must continue to
do it. It would be fatal at this point to show
weakness or truculence. She had been and intended
to be always the honored guest at the
various homes that she visited. The unfortunate
occurrence at Cousin Betty Throckmorton&#8217;s was
to be ignored&mdash;forgotten. Billy was right;
she must dress with care. The matter of the
hall bedroom must be treated lightly and accepted
as a compliment. It wasn&#8217;t as though
she had been put out of the guest chamber.
She knew in her heart that in times that were
past any youthful visitors expected at Buck
Hill must have made way for her, but she did
not acknowledge it to herself or to Billy.</p>
<p>She shook out the sprigged muslin and gave
it to the old man to press. Then, with meticulous
care, she began the business of unpacking.
It was with some irritation that she found only
the top drawer of the bureau empty. In the
other drawers Mrs. Bucknor had put away sundry
articles which she had forgotten about&mdash;remnants
of cloth, old ribbons and laces and
photographs. The hall room was used only
when there was an overflow of guests and only
transient visitors put there. For transients one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
drawer was sufficient. In the wardrobe there
hung an old hunting suit of Jeff&#8217;s and several
dancing frocks belonging to Mildred and Nan,
that had been temporarily discarded to await
future going over by the seamstress.</p>
<p>&#8220;They might have spared me this,&#8221; Miss Ann
muttered, as she endeavored to make hanging
room for her voluminous skirts.</p>
<p>She snatched the offending garments from
the hooks and put them in a pile on the floor.
Then she pulled out the lower bureau drawers
and dumped the contents on top of the old
hunting suit and dancing frocks.</p>
<p>&#8220;There! I shall give them to understand I
am not to be treated with ignominy. I am
Ann Peyton. I have always been treated with
consideration and I always intend to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old eyes flashed and the faded cheeks
flushed. She gave the pile of debris a vicious
little kick. The blow dislodged from the mass
a small, old-fashioned daguerreotype. There
was something about the little picture that was
familiar. She stooped and picked it up. It
was her own likeness, taken at seventeen, a
slender, charming girl whose expression gave
one to understand that she could not be still
much longer. She would have been a better
subject for a motion-picture camera than the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
invention of Daguerre. Youth looked into the
eyes of age and Miss Ann put her hands over
her own poor face as though to hide from youth
the ravages of time. It seemed to her that the
young Ann looked out on the old Ann and
said, &#8220;What have you done with me? Where
am I? You needn&#8217;t tell me that you and I
are one and the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>Slowly she walked to the bureau and slowly
she raised her eyes to the mirror and then gazed
long and sadly at her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ann Peyton, you are a fool. You have
always been a fool. It is too late to be anything
else now and you will go on being a
fool until the end of time. This child had
more sense than you have.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reverently she placed the little daguerreotype
in her handkerchief box. It was the picture
she had given Bob Bucknor, the father of
the present owner of Buck Hill and the grandfather
of Jeff. He had prized it once but now
it was thrown aside and forgotten by all. She
then stooped over and gathered up the articles
on the floor and carefully put them back in
drawers and wardrobe. She washed her face
and hands, straightened her auburn wig, changed
her traveling dress to a more suitable one and
then sailed majestically down the stairs.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>A Question of Kinship</h3>
</div>
<p>Jefferson Bucknor had been away from
home, except for flying visits, for five years.
Like most of the young men of his age, the
World War had broken in on his college course.
He had gone into training at the first suggestion
of his country&#8217;s need. He was then in his
junior year at the University of Virginia. Law
had been his goal and at the close of the war
he hastened back to finish what he had begun.
Determined to hang out his shingle as soon as
possible, he had studied summer and winter until
he got his degree. He was now at home, taking
a much-needed rest and getting acquainted
again with his family. The sisters had grown
up while he was away, and his father and mother
were turning gray. He had only arrived the
day before the coming of Cousin Ann, and
could not help regretting that his sisters were
having this house party. It would have been
pleasant to be quietly at home for a while.</p>
<p>&#8220;When does your company come?&#8221; Jeff
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
asked Mildred. Cousin Ann had joined them
on the front porch, where the family awaited
the summons to dinner. &#8220;Mildred and Nan
are having a swarm of guests,&#8221; he explained to
the old cousin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, indeed!&#8221; said Cousin Ann.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of them come at six-thirty and the
rest at seven from Louisville. We are to meet
them at the trolley. You&#8217;ll go with us, won&#8217;t
you, Jeff?&#8221; asked Mildred.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, if you need me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Need you! I should say we do need you.
Why, you are to fall madly in love with Jean
Roland. We&#8217;ve fixed it all up. She&#8217;s rich and
beautiful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and we put linen sheets on the bed
in the guest chamber,&#8221; broke in Nan. &#8220;Jean
Roland is used to grand things, but she&#8217;ll have
to sleep three in the bed and so will all of
us&mdash;now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; from Mrs. Bucknor. There was
an embarrassed silence. Cousin Ann&#8217;s backbone
stiffened. Mrs. Bucknor looked reproachfully
at her daughters, who giggled helplessly. It
was a relief to have the head of the house arrive
at that moment.</p>
<p>Mr. Bucknor was a hale and hearty man of
fifty, florid and handsome, slightly dictatorial in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
manner, but easily influenced by his wife, who
was all softness and gentleness. He was generous
and hospitable, priding himself on keeping
up the reputation in which Buck Hill had
gloried in the past&mdash;that of an open house
with bed and board for all of the blood. He
greeted his Cousin Ann with a cordiality that
might have been balm to her wounded feelings
had she not been aware that that was Cousin
Bob&#8217;s manner to everybody.</p>
<p>&#8220;And where do you come from, Cousin
Ann?&#8221; he demanded. &#8220;I hope all were well.
Cousin Betty Throckmorton&#8217;s? Well, well! I
thought Sister Sue was to have the honor of
your company. It will keep! It will keep!
Measles at Cousin Betty&#8217;s? Heavens! I hope
none of them will go off in pneumonia. You
must give us a nice long visit. Always glad to
have you, Cousin Ann. Glad to have any of
my kin come and stay as long as they choose.
Blood is thicker than water, I say, and blue
blood is thicker than red blood.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, cousin,&#8221; was all Miss Ann could
say.</p>
<p>&#8220;By the way, Mildred, speaking of falling
in love, who is that pretty girl I saw on the
trolley yesterday?&#8221; asked Jeff. &#8220;I can&#8217;t remember
ever having seen her around here
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
before, but then the girls have all grown beyond
me since I left home. She has what some people
call auburn hair, but I like to call it red,
although it had lots of gold in it. She got
on the last stop before you get into Ryeville.
Seemed to know everybody on the car&mdash;even
the motorman and conductor. At least, I saw
her chatting with them&mdash;the ones who were
relieved at the last switch and were eating their
suppers. She was as lively as a cricket&mdash;was
just bubbling over with energy&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I know who that was,&#8221; said Mildred.
&#8220;It sounds like that forward Judith Buck. She
has no idea of her place. I never saw such a
girl. She rides around the country in a ridiculous
looking little home made blue Ford with
a spring wagon back and puts on all the airs
of sporting a Stutz racer. She never stops for
anybody but just whizzes on by. Sometimes she
even bows to us, although she gets mighty little
encouragement from me, I can tell you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Suddenly there flashed upon Miss Ann&#8217;s inward
eye a picture of a bright-haired girl in a
little blue car who had passed her coach only
that morning, and with the picture came the
remembrance of Uncle Billy&#8217;s words: &#8220;I ain&#8217;t
seed nothin&#8217; in this county ter put &#8217;long side
er you lessen it wa&#8217; that pretty red-headed gal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
what went whizzin&#8217; by us up yonder on the pike
in a blue ortermobubble.&#8221; She remembered that
he had declared the girl looked as she had looked
in her youth.</p>
<p>Mildred continued her diatribe concerning the
lively Judith: &#8220;Surely you remember her, Jeff.
She used to come here selling blackberries when
she was a kid&mdash;a little barefooted girl and as
pert as you please even then. After old Dick
Buck died she used to trap rabbits and bring
them here for sale and sometimes fish. It always
made me mad for Aunt Em&#8217;ly to encourage
her by making Mother buy the things. I
think poor persons should be taken care of all
right but they should know their place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what is her place?&#8221; asked Jeff, a flush
slowly spreading over his handsome, rather
swarthy countenance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I should say her place was at the
back door,&#8221; declared Mildred. &#8220;Old Dick
Buck&#8217;s granddaughter needn&#8217;t expect to get any
social recognition from me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Me either!&#8221; chimed in Nan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course not!&#8221; said Mrs. Bucknor. Mr.
Bucknor was reading the morning paper and
seemed oblivious to the conversation.</p>
<p>&#8220;She doesn&#8217;t look to me like a girl who cared
a whit for social recognition,&#8221; said Jeff quietly,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
although his lip had a curl that showed his disapproval
of his family&#8217;s snobbishness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you believe it,&#8221; said Mildred, with
rather more violence than the subject under discussion
warranted. &#8220;I went to high school
with her for a year and then thank goodness
Father sent me to a private school. She was
the greatest smart Aleck you ever saw. Had
herself elected president of the class and was
always showing off, getting medals for never
being late and never missing a single day of
school since she started. She was always acting
in plays and getting up class entertainments for
devastated Europe. Some of the girls in Ryeville
wanted to ask her to join our club, but I
just told them they could count me out if they
did any such thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Me too!&#8221; said Nan.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I tell you Buck Hill is too nice a place
for parties for the set to let Nan and me out.
She&#8217;s got a place as teacher now, out in the
county near Clayton. I can&#8217;t abide her. She
even had the impertinence to tell some of the
girls once that the original name of her family
was the same as ours&mdash;that her old grandfather,
Dick Buck, had told her so. The idea! Next
she&#8217;ll be claiming kin with us Bucknors.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that? What&#8217;s that?&#8221; asked Mr.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
Bucknor, dropping his paper. &#8220;Who claims
kin with us?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Old Dick Buck&#8217;s granddaughter. Isn&#8217;t it
ridiculous?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; spoke Cousin Ann, coming
into the conversation as a ship in full sail might
break into a fleet of fishing boats. &#8220;Not ridiculous
at all. In fact, quite the proper thing for
the young woman in question to do. She, too,
may have pride of birth and there is no reason
why she should not claim what is due her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But&mdash;&#8221; interrupted Mildred. Miss Ann
Peyton paid no attention at all to the girl. She
addressed her remarks to Jeff, who was all
respectful attention.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, cousin, the Bucks are descended from
the Bucknors quite as much as you or I are.
I recall it all now, although I have not thought
of it for many, many years. I can remember
hearing my grandfather tell of a brother of his
Grandfather Bucknor who, out of pure carelessness,
dropped the last syllable of his name.
It was in connection with a transfer of property.
The deed was recorded wrongly, naming Richard
Buck. He was a lazy man and rather than
go to the trouble of having the matter corrected
he just allowed himself to be called Richard
Buck. He left Kentucky after that, but his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
son returned later on. My grandfather told me
a slump in fortune began from that time and
the Buck branch of the family has been on the
downward road ever since. Perhaps, having
reached the bottom, this young person is now
ascending. But low or high, the fact remains
that she is kin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bless my soul!&#8221; exclaimed Mr. Bucknor, &#8220;I
didn&#8217;t dream that old tale had a word of truth
in it. I&#8217;ve heard old Dick Buck, when he was
drunk, insisting that he belonged to my family,
but it sounded ridiculous on the face of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly!&#8221; chorused Mildred and Nan.</p>
<p>&#8220;However, I must look into the matter,&#8221; the
father continued somewhat pompously. &#8220;If the
girl is kin we must claim her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Bob, I beg of you to do no such
thing,&#8221; said Mrs. Bucknor gently, laying a restraining
hand lightly on her husband&#8217;s arm.
Her touch was soft and light but it held Bob
Bucknor as effectively as iron handcuffs might
have. &#8220;If this girl is as forward as Mildred
and Nan say she is, it would be very embarrassing
to have her constantly asserting her
kinship with our girls. I am sure I do not
know her at all. She is pretty and no doubt is
good, but she is naturally common and evidently
very pushing.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span></p>
<p>&#8220;All right, my dear, all right! You know
best,&#8221; responded Mr. Bucknor.</p>
<p>At this juncture Kizzie announced dinner,
which was a relief to all of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take my arm, Cousin Ann,&#8221; said Jeff
gallantly.</p>
<p>For a moment the old woman and the young
man stood looking off over the rolling meadows
of blue grass. Cutting the lush green pasture
lands was the white limestone turnpike. Far
off in the distance a blue speck appeared on the
white road. In a twinkling it grew into a car
and then went whizzing by, leaving a cloud of
white dust in its wake. Jeff smiled and, glancing
down at his old cousin, caught an answering
smile on her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m rather glad she&#8217;s kin,&#8221; he whispered,
and she gave his arm a tiny squeeze.</p>
<p>Then the thought came to him: &#8220;I wonder
if she is as bold and forward as Mildred says
she is. I wish she hadn&#8217;t been so familiar with
those motormen. That wasn&#8217;t very ladylike to
go up and engage them in conversation. Perhaps
Mildred is right. You could hardly expect
old Dick Buck&#8217;s granddaughter to be very
refined&mdash;but, gee, she&#8217;s a good looker!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>Judith Makes a Hit</h3>
</div>
<p>Judith reached home in time to prepare an
excellent basket supper for her motormen customers.
She was determined that her food
should be so good it would advertise itself and
every employe on the line would demand service.
All of the potatoes were not peeled when she
was ready for them, but her mother&#8217;s explanation
was that it seemed a pity to peel potatoes
because there was so much waste in that method.
It really was better to cook them in the skins.
Judith kissed her and laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Another time we&#8217;ll cook them in their jackets,
Mumsy dear, but I cleared enough money
this morning to afford to waste a few potato
peelings. If I have a week of such luck, I&#8217;ll
have to get in more supplies. The girls in
this county are just eating up my vanishing
cream and my liquid powder that won&#8217;t rub
off. I&#8217;ve made a great hit with my anti-kink
lotion with the poor colored people. Half the
female world is trying to get curled and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
other half trying to get uncurled. I have got
rid of dozens and dozens of marcel wavers, the
steel kind that must dig into you fearfully at
night, and bottle after bottle of that quince seed
lotion, warranted to keep hair in curl for an all-day
picnic, where it usually rains, and, if it
doesn&#8217;t, you fall in the creek to even up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Judy, you take my breath away with such
talk and such goings on. I can&#8217;t bear to think
of your selling things to negroes. There is no
telling what might happen to you if you don&#8217;t
look out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Buck had an instinctive dislike for the
colored race. She never trusted them and was
opposed even to employing them for farm work.
She preferred the most disreputable poor white
to the best negro. It was a prejudice inherited
from her father and mother, who on first coming
to Kentucky had done much talking about
the down-trodden blacks, but being unable to
understand them had never been able to get
along with them.</p>
<p>Old Dick Buck had said of Mr. and Mrs.
Ezra Knight, &#8220;They&#8217;ve got mighty high ideas
about negroes but they ain&#8217;t got a bit of use
for a nigger.&#8221;</p>
<p>Judith shared none of this prejudice. She
liked colored people and they liked her and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
respected her. As she went speeding along the
roads in her little blue car, there was never a
darkey old or young who did not wish her well
and bow low to her friendly greeting. Only
that morning she had given a lift to a bent
old man who was on his way to Mr. Big Josh
Bucknor&#8217;s, and thereby saved him many a
weary mile.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d take you all the way, Uncle Peter, but
I can&#8217;t trust my left hind tire up that bumpy
lane,&#8221; Judith explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t it the truf, Missy? If Mr. Big Josh
would jes stop talkin&#8217; &#8217;bout it an&#8217; buil&#8217; hisse&#8217;f
a road! He been lowin&#8217; he wa&#8217; gonter git busy
an&#8217; backgammon that lane fer twenty-five years
an he ain&#8217;t never tech it yit. That&#8217;s the reason
they done sent fer me. The ladies in the fambly
air done plum wo&#8217; out what with cookin&#8217; fer
comp&#8217;ny an&#8217; washin&#8217; up an&#8217; all. It looks like
comp&#8217;ny air the only thing what don&#8217;t balk at
that there lane. They done sint a hurry call
fer ol&#8217; Peter, kase they got a notion Miss Ann
Peyton air on the way. They phoned down
ter the sto&#8217; fer me ter put my foot in the pike
an&#8217; come erlong. They done got a phome message
from way over yonder at Throckmorton&#8217;s
that dus&#8217; from Miss Ann&#8217;s coach wa&#8217; a risin&#8217;.
They ain&#8217;t mo&#8217;n got shet er a batch er visitings
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
when here come news that Miss Ann air a
comin&#8217;. The ladies air sho&#8217; peeved an&#8217; they
done up an&#8217; said they ain&#8217;t a gonter stay home
an&#8217; Mr. Big Josh tell &#8217;em ter go &#8217;long if they&#8217;s
a min&#8217; an&#8217; he&#8217;n me&#8217;ll look arfter Miss Ann.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But she is at Buck Hill,&#8221; said Judith. &#8220;I
am sure of it. I saw her carriage turning in
there this morning. Poor old lady!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t seein&#8217; that she air so po&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems very pitiful to me for her never to
be wanted, always coming and always having
to pack up and leave. I&#8217;d love to have her
come visit me. You know she and I are of the
same blood, Uncle Peter&mdash;or did you know
it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Land&#8217;s sake, Missy, I mus&#8217; a made a mistake.
I been a thinkin&#8217; all along that I wa&#8217; a
ridin&#8217; with ol&#8217; Dick Buck&#8217;s gran&#8217;baby. You
mus&#8217; scuse me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So you are, Uncle Peter, I am Judith Buck,
but I have just as good a right to be Judith
Bucknor as Mr. Bob Bucknor or Mr. Big Josh
Bucknor, or any of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, bless Bob! Do tell!&#8221; was all the old
man had time to ejaculate, as they came to
the mouth of the lane, bumpy in dry weather
and muddy in wet, and he must leave the swiftly
moving car and again trust to his old limbs to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
carry him on his way. His step was lighter,
however, as he was the bearer of good tidings
to all the white folks at Mr. Big Josh&#8217;s. Miss
Ann Peyton was not coming, but was making
a visit at Buck Hill. He was full of other news,
too, but was not quite sure whether it would be
so welcome to the family.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not that she ain&#8217;t mo&#8217; likelier than mos&#8217; er
the young genderation,&#8221; he muttered.</p>
<p>Judith had a slap-dash impressionistic manner
of cooking all her own, following no rules
or recipes, but with an unerring instinct that
produced results. She said she cooked by ear.
Whatever her method, the motormen were vastly
pleased with the hot suppers she brought them
and the word was passed that the pretty red-headed
girl at the last stop before you got to
Ryeville would furnish a basket supper at a
reasonable figure and soon almost every man
on the line was eager to become one of her
customers.</p>
<p>The first supper was difficult because she was
determined to have it absolutely perfect, and her
mother would insist upon getting in her way,
offering various suggestions that might save a
tenth of a cent.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you, Mumsy, I am not saving but
making. Please sit down in this chair by the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
table, while I behave like the man in the lunatic
asylum who thought he was a steam engine.
I&#8217;m afraid I might get off the track and run
over you. If you just stay still in one spot I&#8217;ll
get through. I can&#8217;t go over you, I can&#8217;t go
around you and I can&#8217;t go under you.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the whistle blowing for two stops
before ours and I&#8217;m ready. Hurrah for a fortune,
Mumsy!&#8221; and with a kiss Judith was off,
bearing a basket in one hand and a tin cooler
of buttermilk in the other.</p>
<p>The Bucks&#8217; farm was a triangle, bounded on
two sides by converging roads and the other by
the pasture lands of Buck Hill. The trolley
line skirted the back of the farm, but turned
sharply toward Ryeville before reaching the corner
where the two roads met. The track curved
about five hundred feet beyond the location of
the stop where Judith had promised to meet
the car with the suppers. There was a short
cut from the rear of the house and Judith always
took short cuts. Through the orchard,
down the hill, across a stream, up the hill, skirting
a blackberry thicket, through a grove of
beeches, dark and peaceful with lengthening
shadows falling on mossy banks, went the girl.
She stopped a moment in the grove and looked
out across the fertile country&mdash;everywhere more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
fertile than the Buck farm but nowhere more
beautiful, she thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I had time to stop here longer,&#8221;
she sighed, putting down her basket and patting
a great beech tree. &#8220;Thank goodness the
Bucks were too lazy to cut you down and the
Knights too slow.&#8221; The honk of an automobile
horn startled her. A seven-seated passenger
car was coming down the road and in the distance
could be seen the approaching trolley.</p>
<p>&#8220;Got to run after all,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;That&#8217;s
what I get for making love to a tree.&#8221; She
flew along the path by the fence and reached
the small station before the trolley slowed down
for the stop. Breathless but triumphant she
stood, large basket in one hand, buttermilk
cooler in the other.</p>
<p>The big motor car, which was driven by Jeff
Bucknor, was parked by the roadside. From it
emerged Mildred and Nan in all the glory of
fresh and frilly lawns and the latest in hats
from a Louisville milliner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Jeff,&#8221; said Mildred, &#8220;you must get
out and meet the bunch, and be sure you make
no mistake. You are to fall in love with Jean
Roland and no one else. She is the smallest
and the darkest and much the best dressed. I
do hope and trust it will be love at first sight.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
She is already just wild about you, without
ever even seeing you, and when she sees you
she is sure to topple over completely.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What nonsense,&#8221; scoffed Jeff.</p>
<p>Mildred ignored the presence of Judith Buck,
although they could not help seeing her, since
her blue cotton dress and her red gold hair
made a spot of color that would surely have
affected the optics of a stone blind person. Her
color was naturally high, and frying chicken
over a hot wood stove and sprinting for the
trolley had added to it. Nan did worse than
ignore the presence of her neighbor, as she
openly nudged her sister and whispered audibly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at her! What do you suppose she
has in her basket?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hot rolls, fried chicken, hashed brown potatoes,
damson jam, radishes and young onions.
Can&#8217;t you smell &#8217;em?&#8221; answered Judith quite
casually, as though announcing a menu at a
restaurant. At the same time she smiled
brightly and looked at the Misses Bucknor with
no trace of either embarrassment or resentment.
Jeff, who was plainly mortified at Nan&#8217;s rudeness,
laughed in spite of himself.</p>
<p>One of the things that irritated Mildred more
than anything else about Judith Buck was
that she seemed never to take offense, nor even
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
to know when an insult was intended. Sometimes
she would wear for a moment a quizzical
smile, but usually she presented what she called
a duck&#8217;s back to intentional slights. Having
satisfied Nan&#8217;s curiosity concerning what was
in her basket, she stepped forward to the platform
and swung the cooler of buttermilk back
and forth in the manner of a brakeman with a
red lantern.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think they will stop here anyhow, Miss
Buck,&#8221; said Jeff. &#8220;Do let me help you on
with your basket. I know it is heavy. I am
Jefferson Bucknor. Perhaps you don&#8217;t remember
me, but I have seen you often when you
were a child. I&#8217;ve been away from home a
long time.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Jeff was introducing himself to Judith
the trolley had slowed up and stopped. Three
young women and two young men were standing
on the platform ready to alight. They
were part of the house party and delighted
greetings were exchanged between them and
Mildred and Nan.</p>
<p>One of the young men, catching sight of
Judith, gave only a hurried handshake to his
hostesses and then sauntered towards the end
of the platform where the girl in blue cotton
was standing. He was a handsome youth,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
dressed in the latest and most pronounced style.
His manner and general carriage were indefinably
impudent. He came quite close to
Judith and peered into her face and only turned
to join the others at a sharp call from Mildred.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom Harbison, come here this minute!&#8221;</p>
<p>At Jeff&#8217;s proffers of assistance Judith had
smilingly thanked him. &#8220;But I&#8217;m not getting
on myself&mdash;only my basket and can of milk,&#8221;
she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll help them on,&#8221; said Jeff, although
Judith assured him she was quite able to do it
herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yonder she is!&#8221; the conductor shouted to
the motorman. &#8220;I knew she would come. I
never knew a red-headed gal to disappoint a
fellow yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eagerly the basket was seized by the hungry
men and loud was their shout of joy over the
can of ice-cold buttermilk.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll find a note inside explaining how
you can phone me if you want extras,&#8221; called
Judith. &#8220;See you to-morrow at the same time.
Be sure and bring back my basket and dishes.&#8221;</p>
<p>The trolley moved off, leaving the house party
grouped at one end of the platform, Judith and
Jeff at the other. It was plain that something
was vexing Mildred and the smart young
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
beauty by her side. Jeff, however, was perfectly
unconscious of being the cause of their
annoyance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you ever so much,&#8221; said Judith.
&#8220;You are a grand assistant to the chief cook.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am delighted to have helped you, but
please tell me what on earth you mean by bringing
food to motormen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mean? Why, it&#8217;s my business. I am
caterer-in-ordinary to the six-thirty trolley and
perhaps others,&#8221; she laughed and looked him
squarely in the eyes. For a moment, in spite
of the persistent demand from Mildred for him
to hurry, Jeff gazed into hers. He flushed a
little and then with a hurried good-bye joined
his sisters and their guests.</p>
<p>Mildred managed to have Jean Roland occupy
the front seat by the driver. Jean was
pretty, well-dressed and no doubt was fascinating.
Jeff remembered he was supposed to
fall in love with her at first sight. Therefore he
looked at her critically. She was all Mildred
had promised, but Jeff found himself gazing
over the head of his companion at a slender
figure in blue gingham, disappearing over the
hill.</p>
<p>It was a distinct annoyance to him that Tom
Harbison should lean far out of the back of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
car and wave his forty-dollar panama hat at
Judith Buck&#8217;s retreating figure, and even a
greater annoyance that Judith should turn
around when she got to the brow of the hill
and see the fine hat doing obeisance to her.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>Cousin Ann Looks Backward</h3>
</div>
<p>Mildred was right. Buck Hill was a perfect
place for parties&mdash;of all kinds. There was a
long, broad hall leading into double parlors on
one side and on the other the dining-room and
sitting-room. The satiny floors&mdash;ideal for
dancing&mdash;reflected in their polished surfaces
rare pieces of old mahogany. French windows
opened on the porches, where comfortable wicker
chairs and hammocks were plentiful.</p>
<p>The garden to the south of the house was
noted in a county famous for gardens. Mr.
Bucknor prided himself on having every kind of
known rose that would grow in the Kentucky
climate. The garden had everything in it a garden
should have&mdash;marble benches, a sun dial, a
pergola, a summer house, a box maze and a
fountain around which was a circle of stone
flagging with flowering portulacca springing up
in the cracks. The shrubs were old and huge,
forming pleasant nooks for benches&mdash;now a
couple of syringa bushes meeting overhead, now
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
lilacs, white and purple extending an invitation
to lovers to come sit on the bench. Oh, Buck
Hill was a place for lovers! The garden a place
of all places!</p>
<p>The house party was in full swing. Five
guests had arrived on the six-thirty and three
more on the seven o&#8217;clock trolley and a car of
six had driven over from Lexington in time for
supper. The mansion was filled and running
over, but the overflow could always be taken care
of in &#8220;The Office,&#8221; a cottage near the house, a
building quite common in old southern homes,
often set aside for young male visitors.</p>
<p>Cousin Ann had been lying down all afternoon
in response to the earnest pleadings of old
Billy. He had pressed the sprigged muslin and
it hung on a hook behind the door in readiness
for the mistress. Then he brought her a pitcher
of water, fresh from the well, and a funny little
tight bouquet of verbenas.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you mought w&#8217;ar &#8217;em in yo&#8217; ha&#8217;r,
Miss Ann,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I &#8217;member how you uster
always w&#8217;ar verbeny in yo&#8217; ha&#8217;r.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So I did, Billy.&#8221; Miss Ann raised her hand
to her hair, but quickly dropped it, remembering
suddenly that her own snowy locks were exposed
to view. She did not relish having even old
Billy see her without her wig. She drew a scarf
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
over her head and Billy turned his away, pretending
he had not seen what she did not want
him to see.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you dress up pretty, Miss Ann, an&#8217;
&#8217;member th&#8217;ain&#8217;t gonter be nary pusson here
what kin hol&#8217; a can&#8217;le to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have they come yet, Billy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some air come an&#8217; mo&#8217; air comin&#8217;, so I
reckon you&#8217;d bes&#8217; rise an&#8217; shine, Miss Ann. Kin
I he&#8217;p you none?&#8221;</p>
<p>Such was the old man&#8217;s devotion to his mistress
that he would gladly have served her as lady&#8217;s
maid had he been called on to do so.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope the fuss these young folks kick up
ain&#8217;t gonter &#8217;sturb you none,&#8221; he said as he
opened the door and shrieks of gay laughter
floated up from the hall below.</p>
<p>The business of dressing was a serious one for
Miss Ann Peyton. In the first place she was
exquisitely neat and particular and every article
of clothing must be exactly right. Her clothes
were old and worn and every time she dressed
some break was discovered that must be darned.
Her hoop skirt was ever in need of repair, with
tapes that had broken from their moorings or
strings that had come loose. On this evening she
discovered a small hole in her little satin slipper
that must be adroitly mended with court plaster.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
The auburn wig must be combed and curled. A
touch of rouge must be rubbed on the poor old
cheeks. The Peyton pearls must be taken from
the strong box&mdash;a necklace, earrings, breastpin
and tiara. When all was over Miss Ann really
did look lovely. With the dignity and carriage
that any queen might have envied she swept
down the broad stairway.</p>
<p>&#8220;Heavens! Mildred, why didn&#8217;t you let us
know you were to have a fancy dress ball?&#8221;
cried Jean Roland, and all of the gay young
things gathered in the broad hall looked up as
Miss Ann descended. To most of them she
was but a figure of fun.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s nobody but old Cousin Ann Peyton,&#8221;
explained Mildred. &#8220;She&#8217;s our chronic
visitor. She always dresses like a telephone
doll.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Ann heard both remarks, but gave no
sign of annoyance, except to hold her head with
added dignity. A chronic visitor could not afford
to show resentment at the thoughtless rudeness
of young persons. It seemed to the old lady
that young cousins in all the homes where she
visited were growing more and more outspoken
and rude and less and less considerate of her.
She still deemed it her right to be honored guest
wherever she chose to bestow the privilege of her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
company, although her self-esteem had had
many a quiet dig and a few hard knocks in the
recent months.</p>
<p>Sometimes the thought came to Cousin Ann
that the young cousins were perhaps taking
their cue from the older generation. Were the
older ones quite as polite and cordial as they had
been? Of course one might expect brusqueness
from Betty Throckmorton, but was there
not a change of manner even here at Buck Hill&mdash;not
just rudeness from Mildred, who was
nothing but a spoiled child, but from Mr. and
Mrs. Bucknor themselves? Then there was Big
Josh and Little Josh, both of whom had made
excuses about having her and had assured her
they would write for her to come to them later
on and she had heard from neither of them.</p>
<p>She paused a moment and looked down on
the happy young people. She wondered if they
realized how happy they were or if it would be
necessary to be old to appreciate the blessing of
merely being young. Suddenly a picture of her
youth came back to her with a poignancy that
almost hurt. It was in that very hall and she
was standing on those very stairs&mdash;perhaps in
that self-same spot. There was a house party
at Buck Hill and she had come from Peyton
only that morning in a brand new carriage with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
Billy driving the spanking pair of nags. Billy
was young then, but so trustworthy that her
father had been willing to let him take charge of
his daughter. She remembered the rejoicing
in the family when she arrived. How they gathered
around her and embraced her! Robert
Bucknor, the father of the present owner, was
then a young man. How gentle and tender he
was with her, how courtly and kind!</p>
<p>When he saw her standing alone on the
stairs looking down on the assembled company
he had sprung up the steps, two at a time, and
taken her hand in his: &#8220;Oh, Cousin Ann, how
beautiful you are! If I could only feel that
the time might come when this would be your
home&mdash;yours and mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>And she had answered, &#8220;Not yet, Cousin
Robert, please don&#8217;t talk about it yet,&#8221; because
the memory of Bert Mason, the young lover
who had been killed in the war, was still too
vivid for her to think of other ties. &#8220;But you
are very dear to me and if ever&mdash;&#8221; Thus she
had put him off.</p>
<p>While she had stood there talking to Robert
Bucknor&mdash;young then and now old and dead
and gone&mdash;Billy, with ashen face, had come
to her with the news that Peyton, her beloved
home, was completely destroyed by fire. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
had fainted. Young ladies usually fainted in
those days when overcome by emotion. How
the friends and cousins rallied around her with
offers of assistance! They actually quarreled
about her, so eager were they for her to visit
them.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must make your home with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, with me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I must have part of her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My turn is next,&#8221; and so on.</p>
<p>And then the owner of Buck Hill and his
sweet wife had told her that their home was
hers and she was ever to feel as free to be there
as though she had been truly a daughter of the
house. Then had begun the years of visiting
for Ann Peyton. Her father had died a few
weeks after the fire and later an only brother.
She had more invitations to visit than she knew
what to do with. Billy had been welcome, too,
and there was always stable room for her horses
and a place in the coach house for her carriage,
no matter where she visited.</p>
<p>How many years had passed since that evening
in June when she had stood in that spot
and looked down on the crowd of young men
and women? She dared not count, but there
was the grandson of that Robert Bucknor,
standing in the great hall and trying hard to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
pretend to be interested in what a beautiful
girl was saying to him. The beautiful girl was
the one who had made the remark about a fancy
dress ball. The grandson of Robert Bucknor
had not heard her say it nor had he heard his
sister&#8217;s cruel answer, as he had come into the
hall the moment afterward. Now he was
plainly bored, but trying to conceal it. The
girl was chattering like a magpie. Suddenly
Jeff looked up and saw Miss Ann.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Cousin Ann!&#8221; he cried, bounding up
the steps, two at a time, quite as his grandfather
had done on that day so many, many
years ago, &#8220;how lovely you look! I&#8217;d like to
dance a minuet with you.&#8221; Then he gave her
his arm and escorted her down the stairs. Supper
was announced immediately and Jeff
marched in with his aged cousin, much to the
chagrin of Mildred, who had planned otherwise
for her good-looking brother.</p>
<p>&#8220;Horrid old thing!&#8221; she said to Tom Harbison,
who was dancing attendance on her.
&#8220;Grabbing Jeff that way! How does she expect
the men to go around if she takes one of
the beaux?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And did you see her with flowers in her
hair?&#8221; asked Nan in a stage whisper. &#8220;Verbenas!&#8221;
and then a fat boy who sang tenor
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
and passed as something of a wag sang:</p>
<table style='margin: auto' summary=''><tr><td>
<p style='margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;'>
&#8220;Sweet Evelina,<br />
Last time I seen her<br />
Stole a verbena<br />
Out of her hair.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>At this all the young folks laughed. Miss
Ann heard Nan&#8217;s stage whisper, and felt Mildred&#8217;s
glance of disapproval and was quite conscious
that the fat boy&#8217;s song was meant to
make game of her, but nothing mattered much
except that Robert Bucknor&#8217;s grandson, who
looked so like him, had run up the steps to
meet her and had told her she looked lovely and
was now holding her hand tightly clasped
against his warm young heart. She saw old
Billy peeping from the pantry door as they
entered the dining-room and she caught his
glance of pride and gratification when she appeared
with the young master.</p>
<p>&#8220;What I tell you?&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;Ain&#8217;t
my Miss Ann the pick er the bunch?&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>The Veterans&#8217; Big Secret</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Mumsy dear,&#8221; said Judith, &#8220;I&#8217;m going
over to Buck Hill this morning and sell all
kinds of things to my cousins and their guests.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Judith, you are not! How can you go
near those people when they treat you like the
dust under their feet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Mumsy, they don&#8217;t. People can&#8217;t
treat you like dust under their feet unless you
are beneath them, and I&#8217;m not in the least
teensy weensy bit beneath the Bucknors of Buck
Hill. Now they might treat me like the dust
in the air&mdash;the dust they have to breathe when
the wind blows&mdash;breathe that or stop breathing
altogether. They might not like to breathe
me in. I might be a little thick for them, but
breathe me they must. I did not make myself
kin to them. I just <i>am</i> kin to them. I don&#8217;t
know that it makes any great difference to me
to know that I am. I rather like to think
that, way back yonder, what is now me had
something to do with building Buck Hill,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
because it is beautiful. The part that&#8217;s me may
have planned the garden. Who knows?</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m not going there to sell things because
they are my cousins. I&#8217;m not going to
mention such a disagreeable subject. I&#8217;m too
good a salesman for that. I am merely going
there because I think I might make some money.
They have a house party on and when people
go visiting they always forget their tooth
brushes and hairpins. I don&#8217;t exactly enjoy
having Mildred Bucknor pretend I&#8217;m not
around when I know I&#8217;m very much in evidence.
She had that way with her at school
and then it would have hurt me, if I had not
been perfectly conscious of the fact that she
couldn&#8217;t tell the difference between nouns and
verbs in Latin and got gender and case and
tense all mixed up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Mumsy, I&#8217;m going to Buck Hill and
clear about five dollars, even though I may
have to take a good snubbing. I want to go
less than ever since Jefferson Bucknor was so
nice to me yesterday evening. I didn&#8217;t tell you
he helped boost my basket on the trolley and
actually took the can of buttermilk in his own
aristocratic hands and swung it on to the platform.
Well, he did, and he made his sister
furious&mdash;and he bored a pretty girl with whom
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
he is supposed to fall in love&mdash;one of the house
party. I don&#8217;t want poor Mr. Jeff Bucknor
to have to take up for me&mdash;which he is sure
to do if the hammers begin to knock&mdash;but even
to spare his feelings I will not quit trying to
sell my wares.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Judith, you must not lower yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not lowering myself one bit, Mumsy.
Just look at it this way: Suppose I had a shop
in Ryeville. Wouldn&#8217;t I serve any customers
who came to the shop, whether they were kin
and refused to admit kinship or not&mdash;whether
they called me red-head, when everybody knows
my hair is auburn, or not? I&#8217;d hardly refuse
to sell to those persons who did not consider
me their social equal and did not ask me to house
parties or to dances when my feet are just itching
to dance. I&#8217;d sell to any and everybody
who came in the shop. Exactly! Well, now
you see I have a shop on wheels. I must go
to any and every body who might have use for
my wares. I&#8217;d have a very limited clientele if
I stuck to those who considered me on their
level and whom I considered on mine. So give
me your blessing, Mumsy, and wish me well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Judith, how you do run on! Aren&#8217;t you
afraid that that Jeff Bucknor will think you
are running after him?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Not in the least. He&#8217;s not that kind of a
man. I know by the way his ears are set and
the way his hair grows on his forehead and the
way his eyes crinkle up at the corners as though
he never missed a joke. People who never miss
jokes don&#8217;t go around thinking other persons
are running after them all the time. I know
by the way he looks out of his eyes. It isn&#8217;t
only his eyes that look at you but there is something
behind them that looks at you. I reckon
if I were a sissy girl I&#8217;d say his eyes were
soulful, but you see I&#8217;m not. I tell you,
Mumsy, my Cousin Jeff is a powerful likely
young man and I&#8217;m quite proud of him. Too
bad he doesn&#8217;t know he&#8217;s my kin.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Buck sighed. &#8220;I guess he wouldn&#8217;t
claim relationship with you if he did know.
Those Bucknors of Buck Hill are a proud-stomached
lot. They&#8217;ve been dusting me on
the pike ever since I was a little girl&mdash;dusting
me and never even seeing me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you ever speak to them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course not. I was never one to put
myself forward.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, why should they speak to you any
more than you speak to them? Aren&#8217;t you as
good as they are? Surely, and a great deal
prettier. You are as much prettier than Mrs.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
Bucknor as a day lily is prettier than a cabbage
rose,&#8221; declared Judith.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, how you do talk, Judy! Of course,
when I say they didn&#8217;t ever speak I mean they
never went out of their way to speak. When
we had deaths over here they kind of acted
neighborly like and sent word to call on them
if we needed anything, but we never did, as my
mother and I always saved mourning from time
to time. I guess they&#8217;d have been a little
more back-and-forth friendly if it hadn&#8217;t have
been for your Grandfather Buck. He was kind
of difficult like when he was drinking and that
was most times. He was either drinking or
getting over drunks as a general thing. Then
he was mighty lazy and shiftless.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor Mumsy! You&#8217;ve had a right hard
time with us Bucks. Grandfather Buck was so
lazy he worried you to death and I&#8217;m so energetic
I know I annoy you terribly. But all
this talking isn&#8217;t selling toilet articles to house
parties. By the way, I got a &#8217;phone message
from my motormen. They want six suppers
this evening. That means I must run into Ryeville
and buy some more baskets and lay in
provisions of all kinds. I wish I&#8217;d been triplets,
or at least twins. I could accomplish so much
more.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Land sakes, Judy! Surely you do enough
as it is. All six dinners at once?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh no! Two on the six, two on the six-thirty
and two for the seven. I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;ll
wear the path into a ditch. I&#8217;m glad to see
the beets are big enough to eat and before you
know it we&#8217;ll have some snap beans and peas.
I&#8217;m going to get a little darkey to work the
garden, because I simply can&#8217;t give the time
for it. Besides, my time is really too valuable
for digging just now. Did I tell you I had
taken the contract to develop all the amateur
photographic films for Baker &amp; Bowles? I
saw them about it the other day. They have
an awful time getting it done right and they
knew I had done a lot of that work for school,
so they asked me to try. Of course I couldn&#8217;t
let such a chance slip and since I can do it at
night I accepted. It will take only one or two
evenings a week. They furnish all the chemicals
and it pays very well. I&#8217;ll do it through
the summer anyhow, until school starts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What a child! What a child!&#8221; was all
Mrs. Buck could say. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe even
the Norse sailor could have beat her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again the old men on the hotel porch were
treated to a sight of Judith Buck. She parked
her little blue car directly across the street from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
the Rye House and began the business of
shopping.</p>
<p>&#8220;What you reckon that Judy gal is up to
now?&#8221; queried Judge Middleton. &#8220;I betcher
she&#8217;s goin&#8217; in the butcher shop.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I betcher she ain&#8217;t,&#8221; said Pete Barnes for
the sake of argument. &#8220;I betcher she&#8217;s going in
the Emporium to buy herself a blue dress.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe,&#8221; ruminated Major Fitch. &#8220;I always
did hold to women folks that had sense
enough to wear blue. That blue that Miss
Judith Buck wears is just my kind of blue too&mdash;not
too light and not too dark&mdash;kinder betwixt
and between, like way-off hills or&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kittens&#8217; eyes,&#8221; suggested Colonel Crutcher
with a twinkle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cat&#8217;s foot! Nothin&#8217; of the kind! Anyhow,
that kind of blue is mighty becomin&#8217; to Miss
Judith.&#8221;</p>
<p>They all agreed to this and when Judith appeared
again with her arms laden with bundles
to be stowed in the back of the car the old men
called in chorus:</p>
<p>&#8220;Hiyer, Miss Judith?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hiyer, yourselves?&#8221; she answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come over and tell us the news,&#8221; they
begged, and she ran across the street and
perched on the railing of the Rye House, while
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
she recounted what news she had picked up on
her peddling trip of the day before.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Peter Turner has gone over to cook
and wash dishes for the ladies at Mr. Big Josh
Bucknor&#8217;s. They haven&#8217;t had a servant for
weeks. They thought Miss Ann Peyton was
coming but she turned in at Buck Hill, I saw
her. She has been visiting the Throckmortons
and left there in a hurry. Old Aunt Minnie,
over at Clayton, has just had her hundredth
descendant. She had sixteen children of her
own and all of them have had their share of
children and grandchildren. I know it&#8217;s so because
I just sold one of the great-granddaughters
some hair straightener and a box of flea
powder and she thought of getting some talcum
powder for the new baby, but decided to use
flea powder instead.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old men laughed delightedly. &#8220;Tell us
some more,&#8221; they demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;The widow Simco, at Nine Mile House,
asked me what had become of Mr. Pete Barnes.
I sold her some henna shampoo and a box of
bronze hairpins.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pete grinned sheepishly, but straightened his
cravat and pulled his whiskers in a way men
have when complimented by the fair sex.</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s your business?&#8221; asked Major Fitch.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Which business?&#8221; asked Judith. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got
so many you&#8217;ll have to say which one. But all
of them are coming on pretty well. I must
be going. So long!&#8221; She was up and away
like a blue flash.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now ain&#8217;t she likely?&#8221; quavered old Judge
Middleton. &#8220;There ain&#8217;t many pretty gals like
her&#8217;d stop an&#8217; gossip with a bilin&#8217; of ol&#8217; has-beens
like us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s the truth,&#8221; said Colonel Crutcher.
&#8220;Did you see Bob Bucknor&#8217;s oldest girl going
by in her father&#8217;s car while Miss Judy was
cheering us up? She had a young blood in with
her&mdash;that young Harbison from Louisville.
He nearly fell out of the car, rubbering at Miss
Judy. That Bucknor miss hardly more than
glanced this way, but she was showing the
whites of her eyes in that glance. My granddaughter,
Betty, was telling me only last night
that the only reason Judy Buck wasn&#8217;t asked to
join their dancing club was that the Bucknor
gals got their backs up about asking her and
kind of talked them down&mdash;calling Judy common
and poor white trash and such like. Betty
says the girls all like her better than they do
the Bucknors, but you know how it is with the
folks from Buck Hill&mdash;they just naturally
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
take the lead in social matters and nobody ever
has crossed them. I wish I had a house of my
own. I tell you I&#8217;d give that Judy Buck a
comin&#8217; out party that would make your hair
curl,&#8221; declared the Colonel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve got a house, but it wouldn&#8217;t be
big enough to ask all the people I&#8217;d want to
have to Miss Judy&#8217;s ball,&#8221; spoke up Major
Fitch.</p>
<p>&#8220;By golly, I got a idee!&#8221; exclaimed Pete
Barnes, letting his chair that had been tilted
against the wall drop on all four legs and bringing
his feet, which had been draped over the
railing, to the floor at the same time with a
resounding stamp. &#8220;I got an idee for sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; asked Major Fitch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s all of us ol&#8217; ones get together an&#8217;
hire the skating rink an&#8217; give Miss Judy Buck
a party that this county won&#8217;t ever forget.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other chairs came down on all fours and
the veterans of the Rye House porch drew
together in solemn conclave. Old tongues
clicked and old beards wagged, while Pete
Barnes&#8217; idea took constructive shape.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll ask all the neighborhood and even
some out of the neighborhood. We&#8217;ll have the
band up from Louisville and a caterer from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
there and do the thing up brown,&#8221; chuckled
Pete.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe society will hold back when we ask
them to come to old Dick Buck&#8217;s granddaughter&#8217;s
ball,&#8221; suggested one.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell &#8217;em whose ball it is until they get
there. That&#8217;s the way to catch the snippy
ones. Let&#8217;s don&#8217;t even tell Miss Judy. It
might make her kind of shy. Just let &#8217;em all
get to dancin&#8217; an&#8217; kinder warmed up an&#8217; then
when we got &#8217;em where they can&#8217;t back out
without bein&#8217; mighty rude we&#8217;ll up an&#8217; make
speeches an&#8217; let the county know how we stand
for that girl an&#8217; what she is an&#8217; how proud
we are of her,&#8221; suggested Judge Middleton.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll get all the old boys in town to come
in on it. I mean our crowd, and there won&#8217;t
be one who will give the secret away. And
we&#8217;ll give that gal a rush that would turn her
pretty red head if it belonged to anybody else&mdash;but
there is no turning a wise head like hers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t let any women in on it either,&#8221;
said Pete.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not even the Widow Simco?&#8221; asked Major
Fitch.</p>
<p>&#8220;The women oughter have looked after the
gal long ago, and now we men folks will take
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
it on us. What&#8217;ll we call the ball?&#8221; asked Mr.
Barnes, ignoring the Major&#8217;s thrust.</p>
<p>&#8220;Call it a dayboo party, but jes&#8217; don&#8217;t say
whose it is,&#8221; suggested Colonel Crutcher.
&#8220;There&#8217;ll be plenty of jokes about it an&#8217; the
smart Alecks will try to get the laugh on us
because they&#8217;ll be a thinkin&#8217; we don&#8217;t know
what dayboo means an&#8217; we&#8217;ll take the laugh an&#8217;
keep it &#8217;til we need it. Lets go get the invites
struck off over to the Ryeville Courier right
now.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old men got busy immediately, although
it was a lazy morning in June and the Rye
House porch was shady and cool. Recruits were
mustered in until they numbered ten, all
anxious and eager to share expense and glory.
First, the skating rink was engaged for the
following Friday night. A caterer in Louisville
was next called up by telephone and supper
ordered, &#8220;with all the fixin&#8217;s&#8221; that the latest
thing in debut parties demanded. The band
was engaged and the invitations set up in type
and printed before the noon whistles blew for
dinner. To be sure, the invitations did somewhat
resemble notices of an auction sale, but
what did it matter to the old men of Ryeville,
who were undertaking this party for their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
favorite girl? This was the card:</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>Judith Scores Again</h3>
</div>
<p>The house party at Buck Hill was not proving
the great success that Mildred and Nan
had hoped for. All of the elements of pleasure
and gaiety were present but to the anxious
hostesses the affair seemed to drag somewhat. In
the first place, brother Jeff utterly refused to
fall in love with their prize guest and the prize
guest, being accustomed to conquest, was peevish
in consequence. Not that Jeff was in the
least rude. On the contrary, he was especially
polite and charming to all of his sisters&#8217; friends,
fetching and carrying for them, dancing with
them, playing tennis with the athletic, talking
sentimental nothings with the romantic, and
gravely discussing the Einstein theory with the
high-brows. He did everything that was required
of him but fall in love with Jean Roland.</p>
<p>The young people were gathered at one end
of the long piazza. At the other end sat Miss
Ann Peyton and Mrs. Bucknor. Miss Ann
was engaged in her favorite occupation of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
crocheting thread lamp-mats and Mrs. Bucknor
vainly endeavoring to get to the bottom of the
family stocking basket. The forenoon is always
a difficult period in which to entertain a house
party. It seems almost impossible to start anything,
at least so Mildred and Nan felt. Even
the most frivolously inclined do not want to
flirt in the morning.</p>
<p>Everybody was feeling a little dull, perhaps
from having eaten more breakfast than is
usual in this day and generation, but Buck Hill
held to the custom of olden times of much and
varied food with which to start the day. One
can&#8217;t be very lively after shad roe, liver and
bacon, hot rolls and corn cakes all piled on top
of strawberries and cream, and the whole washed
down with coffee.</p>
<p>Jean Roland smothered a yawn, a deliberate
yawn&mdash;not the kind you can&#8217;t repress because
the air is close and you feel like a goldfish
when the water in the bowl has not been changed
and you must gape for breath. The fat boy
had been dancing attendance on her for the last
hour and she was wearied with his witty sallies.
Jeff and Willis Truman, a former classmate,
had started a game of bridge with two of the
more serious-minded girls.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bridge is one of the things I can&#8217;t play,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
Jean had announced, and it was hardly complimentary
that the game was being played in
spite of her.</p>
<p>&#8220;By the way, Jeff, you know the Titian-haired
queen you were so taken up with at the
station last evening that you couldn&#8217;t greet your
guests?&#8221; asked Tom Harbison. &#8220;I saw her
again this morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That little country person!&#8221; exclaimed Jean
Roland. &#8220;No style at all to her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a particle!&#8221; echoed Nan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that little cousin of ours?&#8221; said Jeff,
pausing in his game.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jeff, how can you?&#8221; cried Mildred. &#8220;She&#8217;s
a very common person who happens to be named
Buck and now they are trumping up some foolish
old tale that they were Bucknors &#8217;way back
yonder in the middle ages and that they are related
to us. It is too ridiculous for words.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our kin all the same,&#8221; teased Jeff, going on
with his game.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right fetching skirt!&#8221; said Tom. &#8220;She
was flirting with some men on the hotel porch
when we drove by this morning. I reckon they
were all cousins, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeff looked up from his game with a gleam
of anger in his eye. He lost track of the cards,
got confused, played from the wrong hand,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
blocked himself from a re-entry and promptly
got set. All because Tom Harbison intimated
that Judith Buck was not conducting herself
with propriety.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here comes somebody! I saw a car turn in
from the pike,&#8221; announced Nan. &#8220;I hope it
isn&#8217;t any more company.&#8221;</p>
<p>The attention of everyone was focused on
the approaching vehicle. It was Judith&#8217;s little
blue car, skimming down the avenue with the
usual speed exacted of it by its stern young
mistress, who seemed bent on getting at least
thirty-six hours out of the twenty-four. No
one could have said she did not have style in her
manner of turning a curve and neatly landing
at the yard gate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Speak of the devil,&#8221; muttered Mildred, &#8220;if
it isn&#8217;t that Judith Buck. What on earth can
she want?&#8221;</p>
<p>Judith, with her usual expedition, was out of
the car and with sample case in hand was
through the gate and half way up the walk before
any one attempted to answer Mildred&#8217;s
query.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come to see your brother, perhaps,&#8221; suggested
Jean Roland.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, be a sister to me,&#8221; sighed the fat boy,
&#8220;please be a sister to me, Mildred.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span></p>
<p>Judith faltered not a moment, but marched
straight up the steps. The young men all
jumped from their seats and Jeff came forward
with outstretched hand, but the girl pretended
not to see the gesture. With a businesslike
&#8220;Good-morning,&#8221; she proceeded to open
up her sample case and begin her salesman&#8217;s
patter: &#8220;I have here&mdash;&#8221; She was determined
that the call should be purely a commercial one
and that the Bucknors could none of them think
for a moment that she sought or even desired
any social dealings with them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you had better take your wares
to the back door. The servants may want to
buy some,&#8221; suggested Mildred, with more insolence
than her family dreamed she was capable
of showing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you. A little later on I shall take
advantage of your kind suggestion. I have a
line of wares especially put up for back doors.
These things I have been telling you about are
intended for front doors. Unlike most of the
companies who have similar goods on the market,
this one allows the agent to deliver the
article the moment the sale is made,&#8221; Judith continued
in her salesman&#8217;s manner. &#8220;I have a
complete stock of goods in my car and while I
sell by sample you do not have to wait for days
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
and weeks to enjoy the really excellent bargains
I am enabled to offer you. This now is
a cleansing cream. No matter how clean you
may think your face is, you will find after applying
this you are vastly mistaken. Yes, disconcerting
for the moment but comforting when
you realize how much cleaner you are to be than
your neighbor.&#8221;</p>
<p>The young people had gathered around her
and even Miss Ann Peyton and Mrs. Bucknor
put down their work and came to see what
Judith had to sell.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will any one of you young ladies let me
prove the value of this cream by applying it to
the countenance?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anoint me,&#8221; suggested the fat boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, this is intended solely for ladies. I
have a masculine brand to which I am coming
later. I will give a sample jar to any one who
will let me demonstrate on her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Judith&#8217;s manner was businesslike and impersonal,
but her color was heightened by excitement
that she was determined not to show.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you try it on yourself?&#8221; said
Nan. &#8220;I bet yours will come off, all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Judith dipped her fingers in the jar and
daubed her glowing cheek with the cleansing
cream. Everybody laughed. &#8220;And now while
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
we leave this cream on for a minute or two I
will endeavor to interest you in my various
powders.&#8221; She gave an animated recommendation
of powders from talcum to insect.</p>
<p>&#8220;And now we will see the miraculous powers
of the cleansing cream.&#8221; She took a handkerchief
from her pocket and after a vigorous rubbing
of the anointed cheek submitted the evidence
to the audience.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is excellent,&#8221; said Mrs. Bucknor.
&#8220;Let me have a jar.&#8221;</p>
<p>Next Judith demonstrated the virtues of a
vanishing cream and made several sales. Then
the men must be told of an excellent shaving
soap and healing powder. Scented soaps of all
kinds were then displayed, shampoos, hair tonics,
pocket combs, tooth brushes and paste.</p>
<p>The lassitude which had held the house party
in thrall was dispelled. It was almost as though
Judith had applied a cleansing fluid to the atmosphere.
She stood in their midst, displaying
her wares with an earnestness and simplicity that
was most convincing. Who could help but buy
from the girl?</p>
<p>Miss Ann looked at her long and searchingly.
So this was the girl that old Billy thought
resembled his mistress. Her thoughts went back
to her girlhood. When she was the age of this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
Judith could she have so demeaned herself as
to go around peddling cosmetics and soaps?
Certainly not! She would have starved before
she would have stooped to such an occupation.
Starved! What did she know about starving?
The morning she had gone away from Cousin
Betty Throckmorton&#8217;s without her breakfast was
the first time in her life she had ever missed a
meal. Visitors in the blue-grass regions of Kentucky
are not apt to be hungry. Would it have
been better if, when she was young and strong,
she, too, had endeavored to help herself instead
of visiting, eternally visiting?</p>
<p>All of this flashed through the old lady&#8217;s mind.
Suppose there had been no cousins and aunts
and uncles to visit&mdash;what then? Suppose she
had been as this girl was, with no relations on
whom she might depend for assistance. Suppose
her relations had been poor. Suppose
they had not wanted her. Not wanted her!
Did they want her? Did anybody want her?
So intently did she gaze on Judith&#8217;s face that
the girl&#8217;s eyes were drawn in the direction of
the old lady. Miss Ann would have liked to
buy some of the toilet articles, but the quarterly
allowance from her small estate was not due for
many days and never was there money enough
for her to indulge herself in the kind of wares
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
Judith offered for sale. For a moment Judith
stopped her salesman&#8217;s patter and gazed into the
eyes of Cousin Ann Peyton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor old lady!&#8221; was her thought. &#8220;It
must be terrible to be old and idle. I wish I
could do something for her just to let her know
I like her. I believe I might even love her.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sales had been larger than Judith in her
fondest dreams had imagined they could be.
Even the scornful Mildred purchased a few
things that took her fancy and the young men,
one and all, remembered they were sadly in
need of shaving cream and tooth brushes, or
if they were not in immediate need it was just
as well to lay in a supply. There was much
laughing and talking and badinage, but through
it all Judith held herself with a certain poise
that gave all of the buyers to understand that
she was merely the store-keeper and did not wish
to be regarded in any other light.</p>
<p>Jeff was singularly silent while Judith was
crying up her wares. He stood moodily aside,
looking on but never offering to purchase shaving
cream or other masculine requirements. He
wished she had not come. He resented her
placing herself in a position for all of these
wretched persons to patronize her. He hated
the look on Tom Harbison&#8217;s face as he edged
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
closer and closer to the girl, insisting upon putting
down his name for one of every article offered
for sale.</p>
<p>Judith, however, was so bent on being a
salesman that she was absolutely unaware of the
admiration she had evidently created in the
eyes of young Harbison. When she went to her
car to get the wares stored in the back it was
Harbison who sprang forward to assist her.
Jeff watched the couple as they went down the
walk to the yard gate and a suppressed fury
gripped him when he noticed that Tom was
much closer to Judith than was necessary. He
knew perfectly well that Tom Harbison always
walked too close to any girl, and had a habit of
leaning over any member of the fair sex with
a protecting air, occasionally touching her elbow
as though to assist her over anything, even so
small as a pebble, that might be in her way.
When they reached the yard gate one might
have supposed a dragon threatened the ladye
faire, so solicitous was his manner, so brave his
bearing.</p>
<p>Jeff could stand it no longer. He ran down
the steps and with long strides arrived in time
to assist the supposedly helpless maiden.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to help you,&#8221; he said shortly.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s very kind, but really the things are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
not heavy,&#8221; and Judith began busily picking out
the articles from the back of her car and putting
them in a basket.</p>
<p>But Jeff had come to help, and help he
would. He assumed a cousinly air that put
Tom Harbison&#8217;s courtliness entirely in the shade.
If any protecting was to be done he, Jeff Bucknor,
was going to do it. He was the proper
person to carry the basket of toilet articles as
heir apparent to Buck Hill and an avowed kinsman
of the lady. He even managed to crowd
Harbison from the walk as, with basket in one
hand, he protected the astonished Judith with
the other. When the back-door customers were
visited, the young master insisted upon accompanying
Judith, and there he stood guard while
she talked concerning the virtues of her anti-kink
lotion and scented soaps.</p>
<p>She wished he would leave her for a moment,
as she had a little private business to transact
with Uncle Billy, but he stuck closer than any
brother was ever known to stick and she must
let him see her hand to the old man a package,
saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;Please, Uncle Billy, give this to Miss Ann
Peyton and tell her it is from a sincere admirer.
It is just a bottle of lavender water, but I
thought she might like it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span></p>
<p>Uncle Billy bowed so low that his beard almost
touched the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, thank you, missy! I been a
sayin&#8217; that you air the onlies&#8217; one in the whole
county what kin hol a can&#8217;le to what my Miss
Ann wa&#8217; in ol&#8217; days&mdash;an&#8217; air now fer that
matter.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>A Surprise for Cinderella</h3>
</div>
<p>The Ryeville Courier reported that the county
was &#8220;agog&#8221; over the ball to be given by the
veterans of the Rye House porch. Invitations
were delivered with the same expedition that
they had been printed and by nightfall of the
day the scheme was hatched everybody who was
anybody, and a great many who made no pretense
of being, had received a notice that he or
she was expected to come to the skating rink on
Friday night to a debut party.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll show &#8217;em,&#8221; boasted Judge Middleton,
who with Colonel Crutcher had driven about
town in his buggy, delivering invitations.
&#8220;First, we&#8217;ll stop at the Buck place and ask
Judith. We can&#8217;t have a party without our
Cinderella.&#8221;</p>
<p>Judith had returned from her peddling trip,
and was busily engaged in preparing the motormen&#8217;s
supper, when her old admirers arrived.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi, Miss Judy!&#8221; they called from the
buggy.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Hi, yourself!&#8221; she cried, appearing around
the side of the house with floury hands and
flushed face.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re gonter give a ball and we want to
ask you to come to it,&#8221; said the Colonel. &#8220;It
is to be this Friday night coming.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I wish I could, but you know I never
leave my mother at night. You see, she is all
alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you don&#8217;t, but your mother is
especially invited to this ball. See her name is
written over yours on the envelope. Why,
child, it wouldn&#8217;t be a ball unless you came. We&mdash;we&mdash;&#8221;
but here Judge Middleton dug an
elbow into the Colonel&#8217;s ribs and took the conversation
in his own hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact is, Miss Judy, all of us old fellows
think a lot of you and we are kind of &#8217;lowing
you&#8217;d dance with us and make it lively for us.
We&#8217;ll take it as a special favor if you stretch a
point and come&mdash;you and your mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>Judith glowed with appreciation and put a
floury hand on the old man&#8217;s arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Judge Middleton, you are good&mdash;all
of you are so kind to me. I&#8217;d rather come to
your party than do anything in the world. I
never have been to a real ball&mdash;a picnic is
about the closest I&#8217;ve come to one, that and some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
school entertainments, but you see I haven&#8217;t a
suitable dress. You wouldn&#8217;t like me to come
looking like Cinderella after the clock struck
twelve, would you now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;d look better than most even if
you did,&#8221; put in Colonel Crutcher, &#8220;but you
needn&#8217;t be coming the Flora McFlimsey on us.
Don&#8217;t we see you running around here in a
blue dress all the time? And if that ain&#8217;t good
enough I bet you&#8217;ve got a white muslin somewhere
with a blue sash and maybe a blue hair
ribbon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Judith laughed. &#8220;Well, I reckon I have
and, after all, nobody is going to look at me
and I do want to go. I&#8217;ll say yes and I can
bulldoze Mother into accepting, too, I am sure.
I think it is the grandest thing that ever happened
for all of you to be giving a debut
party, and I&#8217;m going to come, and what&#8217;s more,
I intend to dance every dance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you are talkin&#8217;,&#8221; shouted the old men.
&#8220;Save some dances for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>After they had driven away, the buggy enveloped
in the inevitable cloud of limestone dust,
Judith still stood in the yard until she saw the
cloud, little more than a speck in the distance,
turn into the Buck Hill avenue.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon they&#8217;ll all laugh at the dear old
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
men and make fun of their having a debut party
for themselves, but I think it is just too sweet
of them. Oh, oh, oh, if I only had a new
dress!&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a general invitation for Buck Hill,
family and visitors, and an especial one for Miss
Ann Peyton, to whom the old men of Ryeville
wished to show marked respect as being of their
generation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, we shall all go,&#8221; announced Mr.
Bucknor.</p>
<p>&#8220;It sounds rather common,&#8221; objected Mildred.
&#8220;And only look at the invitations! Did
anyone ever see such ridiculous-looking things?&#8221;</p>
<p>But everyone wanted to go in spite of Mildred&#8217;s
uncertainty, so R. S. V. P.&#8217;s were sent
P. D. Q. and old Billy got busy greasing harness
and polishing the coach so that his equipage
might be fit for the first lady of the land to go
to the ball.</p>
<p>&#8220;Air you gonter &#8217;pear in yo&#8217; sprigged muslin?&#8221;
he asked Miss Ann, &#8220;or is the &#8217;casion sech
as you will w&#8217;ar yo&#8217; black lace an&#8217; diments?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Black lace and diamonds,&#8221; said Miss Ann,
&#8220;but I shall have to begin darning immediately.
Lace is very perishable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It sho&#8217; is,&#8221; agreed Billy. Far be it from him
to remind his mistress that the black lace had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
been going long enough to deserve a pension.
So Miss Ann darned and darned on the old
black lace and with ammonia and a discarded
tooth brush she cleaned the diamond necklace
and earrings and the high comb set with brilliants
and her many rings. It was exciting to be
going to a ball again. It had been many a year
since she had even been invited to one. She was
as pleased as a child over having an invitation
all to herself&mdash;not that she would let anyone
know it, but she let old Billy express his gratification.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you, Miss Ann, that there Colonel
Crutcher air folks, him an&#8217; Judge Middleton
both. They don&#8217;t put on no airs but they&#8217;s
folksy enough not ter have ter. I reckon they
knowed you&#8217;s a gonter be the belle er the ball
wheresomever it air an&#8217; that&#8217;s the reason they
done brung you a spechul invite.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old men of the town met on the Rye
House porch after supper that night to report
progress.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything&#8217;s goin&#8217; fine,&#8221; was the general
report.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not an out-and-out refusal yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Came mighty near not getting Miss Judith,&#8221;
said Colonel Crutcher. &#8220;First she couldn&#8217;t
leave her mother and then when we told her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
Mrs. Buck was especially invited she put up a
plea of not having the right kind of dress.
Said she&#8217;d look like Cinderella after the clock
struck twelve. But the Judge and I looked
so miserable over it that the child finally said
she&#8217;d come, but I reckon she&#8217;ll be wearing an
old dress.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks like she&#8217;s got so many businesses she
might buy herself a dress,&#8221; suggested one.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not her. She&#8217;s saving every cent to put
guano on the land.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, beauty unadorned is adorned the
most,&#8221; mused Major Fitch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, I got a idee,&#8221; put in Pete Barnes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go to it, Pete! Your idees are something
worth while here lately. What is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the reason we can&#8217;t get little Judy
a dress over to Louisville? Us old men can all
chip in an&#8217; it wouldn&#8217;t amount to mor&#8217;n a good
nights losin&#8217; at poker.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s right proud. Do you reckon she&#8217;d
get her back up and decline to accept it?&#8221;
asked Judge Middleton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not Judith. She&#8217;s not the kind to be hunting
slights, but suppose we send it to her
anonymous like and pretend her fairy godmother
had something to do with it,&#8221; suggested
Pete.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And who&#8217;s gonter buy it? We don&#8217;t want
any of the Ryeville women in on this,&#8221; said
Colonel Crutcher.</p>
<p>&#8220;I got another idee,&#8221; said Pete. &#8220;Let&#8217;s get
the motormen to get their wives down at the
other end to shop for us. I was talkin&#8217; to one
only this mornin&#8217; an&#8217; he said Miss Judy cooked
the best dinner he ever et an&#8217; I&#8217;m pretty sure
they&#8217;d be glad to help us out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But they might help us out too gaudy like.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee, they couldn&#8217;t go wrong if we told them
it must be white&mdash;white with a blue sash.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like it to be white tarlatan or something
thinnish and gauzy like and kind of stand-outy
without being stand-offish.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I think a few gold beads, kind of trimming
it up, would be becoming to our debutante.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And we ought to get her slippers and stockings
to match.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How about the size?&#8221;</p>
<p>That was a stumper until Pete Barnes had
another idee, and that was that old Otto
Schmidt, the trusty shoe repairer of Ryeville,
might know. He did. In fact, even then he
had a pair of Judith&#8217;s shoes to be half soled.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s schlim and long,&#8221; said Otto, &#8220;five
and a half touble A.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span></p>
<p>So five and a half double A it was. &#8220;And
make &#8217;em gold,&#8221; suggested the Colonel.</p>
<p>The motorman approached was delighted to
undertake the commission. &#8220;My wife&#8217;s pretty
grateful not to have to be worrying herself to
death about my supper and she&#8217;ll be tickled
stiff to have a chance to go spend some money
even if it isn&#8217;t for herself. She used to be
saleslady in the biggest shop in Louisville, before
she married me. She&#8217;s just about Miss
Buck&#8217;s size, too,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Minute directions were given the kindly motorman
as to the dress being white and thinnish
and standoutish, with a blue sash and gold bead
trimming, the slippers long and slim and gold.</p>
<p>&#8220;A blue ribbin for her hair, if you don&#8217;t
mind, too,&#8221; said Pete Barnes. &#8220;I been always
a holdin&#8217; that there ain&#8217;t anything so tasty as a
blue ribbin in a gal&#8217;s hair.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t wear ribbons in their hair any
more,&#8221; said Major Fitch. &#8220;I believe they all
are using tucking combs nowadays.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, I give in. Our gal must be
stylish, but I&#8217;d sure like a blue ribbin in her
hair. Get her a good tuckin&#8217; comb then.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ball was to be on Friday. Judith&#8217;s mind
was so full of it she found it difficult to attend
to her many self-imposed duties.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Actually, Mumsy, I tried to sell anti-kink to
a bald-headed white man. I really believe I
shall have to give up my peddling job until
after the ball is over,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Mrs. Buck had entered only half-heartedly
into the plan of going to the ball, and had agreed
to go only because Judith had pleaded so earnestly
with her. Her best and only black silk
must be taken out and sunned and aired and
pressed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I declare, I&#8217;ve had it so long the styles
have caught up with it again,&#8221; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I wish I could say the same for my
white muslin,&#8221; sighed Judith. &#8220;I&#8217;ve a great
mind to wear it hind part before, to make a
little change in it. Anyhow, I intend to have
just as good a time in it as though it were
white chiffon, embroidered in gold beads. My
white pumps aren&#8217;t so bad looking. I&#8217;ll take
time to-morrow to shampoo my hair. Do you
know, Mumsy, Cousin Ann Peyton&#8217;s wig is
just the color of my hair. Poor old lady! Pity
she can&#8217;t lose it!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was Thursday night. The day&#8217;s work was
over, the last dish from the motormen&#8217;s supper
washed and put away and Mrs. Buck and her
daughter were having a quiet chat, seated on the
side porch. It was a pleasant spot, homelike
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
and comfortable. It was on this porch that the
summer activities of the farm were carried on.
Here they prepared fruit for preserving and
even preserved, as a kerosene stove behind a
screen in the corner gave evidence. Here they
churned, in a yellow cradle churn, and worked
the butter.</p>
<p>&#8220;It saves the house if you can do most of
your work in the open,&#8221; Mrs. Buck had said.</p>
<p>Judith had stretched a hammock across the
corner of the porch, and now she was allowing
herself to relax for awhile before going to bed.
She pushed herself gently to and fro with one
slender foot on the porch floor, and looked out
dreamily over the fields flooded with moonlight&mdash;fields
bought by her grandfather Knight
from her grandfather Buck, inherited by him
from his father, who had inherited from his
father. Each generation had done what it
could to impoverish the land and never to improve
it. Now it was up to her, nothing but a
slip of a girl nineteen years old, to buy guano
and bring the land back to its original value.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ho, hum! If Grandfather Buck hadn&#8217;t
wasted so much and Grandfather Knight hadn&#8217;t
saved so much I could put my earnings in a
new georgette dress to wear to the old men&#8217;s
debut ball,&#8221; she sighed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span></p>
<p>A few vehicles passed the house&mdash;now an
old-fashioned buggy, now a stylish touring car&mdash;each
one leaving a trailing cloud of limestone
dust.</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen, Judith, I heard the gate click.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing but an owl clucking, Mumsy. I
heard it, too, but nobody would be coming to
see us this time of night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It might be some young beaux coming to
see you,&#8221; suggested Mrs. Buck. &#8220;You&#8217;d have
plenty of them if you weren&#8217;t so&mdash;so&mdash;businesslike.&#8221;</p>
<p>Judith laughed merrily. &#8220;Well, I reckon
they&#8217;d come anyhow if they wanted to, but I
must say, Mumsy, I&#8217;m kind of snobbish about
your so-called beaux. I might like the boys if
they would only stop being so silly and understand
that I&#8217;m a human being with a mind and
soul. I reckon I&#8217;ve always been too busy to
play much with the boys around Ryeville. The
old men like me though.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not getting anywhere,&#8221; complained
Mrs. Buck, who frankly hoped for a husband
for her daughter, although her own matrimonial
venture had not been any too successful.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was a knock!&#8221; insisted the mother a
moment later. Judith jumped up from the
hammock. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go outside and see who it is.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed you won&#8217;t! If it&#8217;s callers you&#8217;ve
got to receive them in the house. Just light
the lamp in the parlor and then open the door.
I ain&#8217;t fit to see anybody so I won&#8217;t go in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Judith did as her mother directed, lit the lamp
in the parlor and then cautiously opened the
door. Nobody was there, but a large dress box
was leaning against the door and fell into the
hall when the door was opened. The girl picked
it up and carried it into the parlor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mumsy! Come quick! I don&#8217;t know what
it is but it isn&#8217;t a beau. Never mind your dress,
but just come!&#8221;</p>
<p>The string was broken by eager young hands,
although Mrs. Buck begged to be allowed to
pick out the knots. The top of the box was
snatched off, disclosing much white tissue paper
with a folded note pinned in the center.</p>
<p>&#8220;It must be flowers,&#8221; cried Judith. &#8220;I&#8217;m
so excited I can&#8217;t make up my mind to take off
the wrappings.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, read the note! It&#8217;s addressed to you,&#8221;
said Mrs. Buck.</p>
<p>&#8220;It says: &#8216;To Miss Judith Buck, from her
old fairy god-fathers.&#8217; Oh, Mumsy, my old
men are sending me some flowers, to wear to the
ball, I guess. I&#8217;ll clip the stems to keep them
fresh.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, why don&#8217;t you open &#8217;em up?&#8221;</p>
<p>Layer by layer Judith removed the tissue
paper. At last the precious contents of the box
were revealed&mdash;a white chiffon dress, delicately
broidered with tiny gold beads, with a twisted
girdle of blue with cloth of gold, a dainty blue
comb set with brilliants. In a separate wrapper
at one end of the box, gold slippers and stockings
were discovered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mumsy! I&#8217;m going to cry,&#8221; and Judith
did shed a few tears and sob a few sobs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely you are not going to accept clothes
from any man, Judith.&#8221; Mrs. Buck&#8217;s tone was
stern and disapproving.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course not from any one man, but this
is from about ten men&mdash;the dear old men who
are giving the ball! I wouldn&#8217;t be so mean as
not to accept this gift. What&#8217;s more, I&#8217;m going
to try the things on this minute. Look! There&#8217;s
even a silk slip to wear under it. Whoever
bought this outfit knew how to buy. Mumsy,
Mumsy! The slippers fit. Oh, I&#8217;m a real
Cinderella, but the best thing about it is that
the old men must truly love me, the dears.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>Jeff Gives a Pledge</h3>
</div>
<p>Until recently it had been the custom for Miss
Ann Peyton, on every fine afternoon, to have
old Billy drive her forth for an airing. It exercised
the horses and gave Billy a definite occupation,
besides affording some change of scene
for his mistress. This habit of a lifetime had
been abandoned because Miss Ann and Billy
had come to a tacit understanding that the less
the old coach was used the better for all concerned.
Like the hoop skirt, little of the original
creation remained. It had been repaired here
and renewed there through the ages, until the
body was all that the carriage maker would have
acknowledged and that had many patches.</p>
<p>The coach had been a very handsome vehicle
in its day, with heavy silver mountings and
luxurious upholstery. The silver mounting was
Billy&#8217;s pride and despair. No fussy housekeeper
ever kept her silver service any brighter than
Billy did the trimmings of the old carriage, but
in late years there never seemed to be room in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
any carriage house for Miss Ann&#8217;s coach and it
took much rubbing to obliterate the stains caused
by continual exposure. Billy often found a new
rent in the cushions, from which the hair stuffing
protruded impertinently. He would poke it
back and take a clumsy stitch only to have it
burst forth in a fresh place.</p>
<p>There had always been a place in the carriage
house at Buck Hill for Cousin Ann&#8217;s coach until
the family had gone in largely for automobiles
and then the carriage house had been converted
into a garage, the horse-drawn vehicles in a great
measure discarded and now the ancient coach
must find shelter under a shed, with various
farming implements. Billy felt this to be as
much of an insult as putting his mistress out of
the guest chamber, but he must make the best
of it and never let Miss Ann know. Of course
the coach must be ready to take the princess to
the ball. Wheels must be greased and silver
polished.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wisht my mammy done taught me howter
sew,&#8221; old Billy muttered, as he awkwardly
punched a long needle in and out of the cushions,
vainly endeavoring to unite the torn edges.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, Uncle Billy?&#8221; asked
Jeff Bucknor, who had just crawled from under
one of the cars, where he had been delightfully
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
employed in a manner peculiar to some males,
finding out what was wrong with the mysterious
workings of an automobile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothin&#8217; &#8217;tall, Mr. Jeff! I wa&#8217; jes&#8217; kinder
ruminatin&#8217; to myse&#8217;f. I din&#8217;t know nobody wa&#8217;
clost enough ter hear me. I wa&#8217; &#8217;lowin&#8217; ter sew
up this here cushion so&#8217;s it would las&#8217; &#8217;til me&#8217;n
Miss Ann gits time ter have this here ca&#8217;ige
reumholzered. We&#8217;re thinkin&#8217; a nice sof&#8217; pearl
gray welwit will be purty. What do you think,
Mr. Jeff?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think pearl gray would be lovely and it
would look fine with the handsome silver mountings,
but in the meantime wouldn&#8217;t you like me
to give you some tow linen slips that belong to
one of the cars. You could tack them on over
your cushions and it would freshen things up
a lot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thankee, Marster, thankee! If it wouldn&#8217;t
unconwenience you none.&#8221; Old Billy&#8217;s eyes were
filling with tears. It was seldom in late years
that anyone, white or colored, stopped to give
him kind words or offers of assistance. The
servants declared the old man was too disobliging
himself to deserve help and the white people
seemed to have forgotten him.</p>
<p>Jeff got the freshly laundered linen covers
and then climbed into the old coach and deftly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
fastened them with brass headed tacks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I do hope Cousin Ann will like her
summer coverings,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s sho&#8217; too&mdash;an&#8217; we&#8217;s moughty &#8217;bleeged
ter you, Marse Jeff. Miss Ann an&#8217; me air jes&#8217;
been talkin&#8217; &#8217;bout how much you favors yo&#8217;
gran&#8217;pap, Marse Bob Bucknor as war. I don&#8217;t
want ter put no disrespec&#8217; on yo&#8217; gran&#8217;mammy,
but if Marse Bob Bucknor had er had his way
Miss Ann would er been her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe I have heard that Grandfather was
very much in love with Cousin Ann. Why did
she turn him down?&#8221; asked Jeff, trying not to
laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, my Miss Ann had so many beau lovers
she didn&#8217;t know which-away ter turn. Her bes&#8217;
beau lover, Marse Bert Mason, got kilt in the
wah an&#8217; Miss Ann got it in her haid she mus&#8217;
grieve jes&#8217; so long fer him. But the truf wa&#8217;
that Miss Ann wouldn&#8217;t a had him if he had er
come back. She wa&#8217;n&#8217;t ready ter step off but
she wa&#8217; &#8217;lowin&#8217; ter have her fling. Then the ol&#8217;
home kotched afire an&#8217; then me&#8217;n Miss Ann
didn&#8217;t have no sho&#8217; &#8217;nough home an&#8217; we got ter
visitin&#8217; roun&#8217; an&#8217; Marse Bob, yo&#8217; gran&#8217;pap, kep
a pleadin&#8217; an&#8217; Miss Ann she kep&#8217; a visitin&#8217;, fust
one place then anudder, an&#8217; Marse Bob he got
kinder tired a followin&#8217; aroun&#8217; takin&#8217; our dus&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
an&#8217; befo&#8217; you knowd it he done tramsfered his
infections ter yo&#8217; gran&#8217;mammy, an&#8217; a nice lady
she wa&#8217;, but can&#8217;t none er them hol&#8217; a can&#8217;le ter
my Miss Ann, then or now&mdash;&#8217;cept&#8217;n maybe
that purty red-headed gal what goes a whizzin&#8217;
aroun&#8217; the county an&#8217; don&#8217;t drap her eyes fer
nobody. &#8217;Thout goin&#8217; back a mite on my Miss
Ann, I will say that that young white gal sho&#8217;
do run Miss Ann a clost second.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean Miss Judith Buck, Uncle Billy?&#8221;
and Jeff&#8217;s face flushed. He had been thinking
a great deal about Judith Buck and he was
trying to school himself to stop thinking about
her. Yet it pleased him that the old darkey
should thus mention her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes sah, Miss Judith Buck.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodness, Uncle Billy, what is that strange
rumbling and buzzing I hear?&#8221; interrupted
Jeff. &#8220;Your carriage sounds as though you
had installed a motor in the rear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lawsamussy, Mr. Jeff, that ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; but
a bumbly bee nes&#8217;, what we done pick up somewhere
on our roun&#8217;s. Them bees sho&#8217; do give
me trouble an&#8217; it looks like I can&#8217;t lose &#8217;em.
&#8217;Course I could smoke &#8217;em out but somehow I
hates ter make the po&#8217; things homeless an&#8217; I
reckon they&#8217;s got a notion that the hollow place
in the back er this here ca&#8217;ige b&#8217;longs ter them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
an&#8217; the knot hole they done bored is the front
do&#8217;. When me&#8217;n Miss Ann has ter drive on I
jes&#8217; sticks a cawn cob in the hole an&#8217; the bees
trabels with us. Sometimes their buzzin&#8217; air
kinder comp&#8217;ny ter me. I ain&#8217;t complainin&#8217; but
times I&#8217;m lonesome an&#8217; I wisht I mought er had
a little cabin somewheres an&#8217; mebbe some folks
er my own.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Uncle Billy, I know you must get tired
of not having a real home of your own. Didn&#8217;t
you ever marry and haven&#8217;t you any kin?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No sah, I ain&#8217;t never married an&#8217; as fer as
I knows I ain&#8217;t got any kin this side er the
grabe. You see, sah, it wa&#8217; this a way. I been
kinder lookin&#8217; arfter Miss Ann sence she wa&#8217; a
gal an&#8217; I always said ter myself, &#8216;Now when
my mistis marries I&#8217;ll go a courtin&#8217; but not
befo&#8217;.&#8217; I had kinder took up with Mandy, a
moughty likely gal back there jes&#8217; after the
wa&#8217; and me&#8217;n her had been a talkin&#8217; moughty
sof&#8217; befo&#8217; Miss Ann lef&#8217; home that time when
the ol&#8217; place burnt up. It looks like I never
could leave Miss Ann long enuf to go back an&#8217;
finish my confab with Mandy. An&#8217; arter a
while Mandy must er got tired of waitin&#8217; fer me
an&#8217; she took up with a big buck nigger from
Jeff&#8217;son County an&#8217; they do say she had goin&#8217;
onter twenty chilluns an&#8217; about fo&#8217; husbands.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Billy, you have certainly been faithful
to Cousin Ann. I don&#8217;t see what she would
have done without you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gawd grant she won&#8217;t never have ter, Marse
Jeff! It&#8217;ll be a sad day fer this ol&#8217; nigger when
Miss Ann goes but I&#8217;m a hopin&#8217; an&#8217; prayin&#8217;
she&#8217;ll go befo&#8217; I&#8217;m called. If I should die they
would&#8217;n be nobody ter fotch an&#8217; carry fer Miss
Ann. She gits erlong moughty fine here at
Buck Hill, but some places I have ter kinder
fend fer us-alls right smart. Miss Ann air that
proudified she don&#8217;t never demand but ol&#8217; Billy
he knows an&#8217; he does the demandin&#8217; fer her.
An&#8217; I presses her frocks an&#8217; sometimes I makes
out to laundry fer her in some places whar we
visits an&#8217; the missus don&#8217;t see fit ter put Miss
Ann&#8217;s siled clothes along with the fambly wash.
An&#8217; I fin&#8217;s wil&#8217; strawberries fer her, an&#8217; sometimes
fiel&#8217; mushrooms, an&#8217; sometimes I goes out
in the fall an&#8217; knocks over a patridge an&#8217; I picks
an&#8217; briles it an&#8217; sarves it up fer a little extry
treat fer my lady.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She certainly would be lost without you,
Uncle Billy, but I&#8217;m going to make you a
promise. If you should be called before my
cousin I do solemnly swear that I&#8217;ll see to it
that she has every comfort. The family owes
you that much and I for one will do what I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
can for Cousin Ann. On the other hand, if
Cousin Ann should go first, I&#8217;ll do what I can
to help you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Marse Bob&mdash;I mean Marse Jeff&mdash;you
air lif&#8217; a load from a ol&#8217; man&#8217;s heart. Yo&#8217;
gran&#8217;pap air sho&#8217; come ter life agin in his
prodigy. Nothin&#8217; ain&#8217;t gonter make much diffunce
ter me arfter this. I been a thinkin&#8217;
some er my burdins wa&#8217; mo&#8217; than I kin bear,
but &#8217;tain&#8217;t so. My back air done fitted ter
them, kase you done eased me er my load.&#8221;
The old man wept, great tears running down
his furrowed brown cheeks and glistening on
his long, grotesque beard.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>The Debut Party</h3>
</div>
<p>Everything was propitious for the debut
party, even the weather. A brisk shower in the
morning, followed by refreshing breezes, gave
assurance of a night not too hot for dancing
but not too cool for couples so inclined to sit
out on the balcony and enjoy the moonlight.</p>
<p>The ten old men were very much excited
as the time approached for their ball. The
skating rink was swept and garnished and decorated
with bunting and flags, and wreaths of
immortelles rented from the undertaker. Extra
chairs were also furnished by that accommodating
person. The caterer from Louisville
came in a truck, bringing with him stylish negro
waiters and many freezers and hampers. The
musicians arrived on the seven o&#8217;clock trolley,
almost filling one car with their great drums
and saxophones and bass fiddles.</p>
<p>The women who were either supported by,
or supported, the ten old men were kept busy
by their aged relatives hunting shirt studs and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
collar buttons, pressing broadcloth trousers, letting
out waistcoats or taking them up, sewing
on buttons and laundering white ties. The
barber had to call in extra help, because of the
trimming of beards and shaving of chins and
cutting of hair that the party entailed.</p>
<p>Judge Middleton was chosen to make the
speech naming the guest of honor for whom the
debut party was given.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s got the gift of gab,&#8221; Pete Barnes
had said, &#8220;but I hope he ain&#8217;t gonter forget
&#8217;twas my idee.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the many virtues that belong to
country people is that they come on time. At
eight o&#8217;clock the fiddles were tuning up, the
skating rink lights were on and already Main
Street was crowded with a varied assortment of
vehicles&mdash;automobiles, buggies, wagons, surreys,
rockaways and even a large hay wagon
that had brought a merry party of young folks
from Clayton.</p>
<p>Buck Hill arrived, three automobiles strong,
besides Miss Ann Peyton&#8217;s coach. Behind them
came Judith Buck and her mother, the little
blue car brave from a recent bath and Judith&#8217;s
eyes shining and dancing like will-o-the-wisps.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mumsy, listen! They are tuning up! I&#8217;m
going to dance every dance if I have to do it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
by myself. I don&#8217;t know any of the new
dances, but it won&#8217;t take me a minute to learn.
It&#8217;s the golden slippers that make me feel so
like flying.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Judy, don&#8217;t take on so. It ain&#8217;t
modest to be so sure you&#8217;ll be asked to dance.
Besides, you must save your dress and slippers
and not wear them out this first time you wear
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Judith laughed happily. &#8220;Oh, Mumsy, what
a spendthrift you are with your breath! I&#8217;m
going to dance my dress to a rag. Did you
ever think that Cinderella may have just danced
her dress to rags by twelve o&#8217;clock and after
all the fairy godmother had nothing to do with
it? Cinderella danced every dance with the
prince and perhaps he was an awkward prince
and tangled his feet in her train. In fact, I
am sure he was awkward or he would have
caught up with her when she tried to run away,
and she with one shoe off and one shoe on
like &#8216;Diddle, diddle, dumpling, my son John!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me help you out, Mrs. Buck.&#8221; It was
Jeff Bucknor, leaning over the little blue car.
He had heard every word of Judith&#8217;s foolishness
and seemed to be much pleased with it,
considering he was a learned young lawyer
getting ready to hang out his shingle, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
supposed to be above fairy stories and nursery
jingles.</p>
<p>Jeff had noticed, as he passed Judith&#8217;s home,
that the little blue car was parked in front and
his surmise was that the girl was going to the
ball but had not yet gone. He registered the
determination to hurry his own crowd into the
skating rink and wait and speak to Judith.
This decision had come immediately after his
promising himself that he wasn&#8217;t even going
to think any more about the girl, and that if
she happened to be one of the guests at the
debut party he was going to spend the evening
being pleasant to his sisters&#8217; friends and not
even ask her to dance.</p>
<p>Mrs. Buck accepted his offer of assistance
with shy acquiescence. The blue car was not
easy to get out of, as the seat was low and
there was no step, so Jeff must swing the lady
out, lifting her up bodily and jumping her to
the curbing. She came down lightly but flustered.</p>
<p>Unreasoning anger filled Jeff Bucknor&#8217;s
heart when he released the blushing Mrs. Buck
to find Tom Harbison had pushed his way in
between the sidewalk and the blue car and was
insisting upon helping Judith to alight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks awfully, but I am accustomed to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
getting out by myself,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I am accustomed to helping beautiful
young ladies out of cars,&#8221; said Tom. &#8220;You
don&#8217;t know what a past master I am in the
art.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If there were any beautiful young ladies
around I am sure they would be delighted, but
since there are not any in sight your art will
have to languish for lack of exercise,&#8221; flashed
Judith.</p>
<p>Mrs. Buck and her daughter had both covered
their finery with old linen dusters, which
they had planned to discard before entering the
hall. It was a distinct annoyance to Mrs. Buck
that these two handsome young cavaliers should
see them thus enveloped.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll get the wrong impression of my
girl,&#8221; was her thought, and now here was Judith
wasting her time and the precious dancing
hours bantering with a strange young man as
to whether she should be allowed to jump from
her car unassisted or should be helped out in a
ladylike manner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Judith, come along one way or the
other,&#8221; Mrs. Buck drawled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps Miss Buck would take one of my
hands and one of yours,&#8221; suggested Jeff to
Tom.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps the decrepit old lady will,&#8221; laughed
Judy, making a flying leap between their outstretched
hands without touching them and
landing lightly on the sidewalk by her mother.
&#8220;Thank you both very much,&#8221; she said, and
clutching her mother&#8217;s arm she hurried into the
lobby of the skating rink and was lost to view
in the crowd of arriving guests.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s the dressing-room, Mumsy, and we
can leave our awful old dusters in there.
Weren&#8217;t you furious at being seen in the horrid
things and that by the best beaux of the ball?
Now, Mumsy, you just stick to me and we&#8217;ll
go say howdy to the dear old men and thank
them for my dress and shoes and stockings and
then you can go sit by some of your nice church
members, while I find somebody to dance with
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Judy, surely you are not going to
thank the old men right out before everybody,
and surely you are not going to ask anybody to
dance with you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course not, Mumsy! I&#8217;m going to use
finesse about both things. You just see how
tactful I am. Oh! Oh! Oh! I&#8217;m so excited!
Just look at the streamers and flags and all
the funny funeral wreaths, and only listen to
the music! I&#8217;m about sure there are wings
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
on my golden slippers. Really and truly,
Mumsy, they do not touch the ground when I
walk. I&#8217;m simply floating in a kind of nebulous
haze&mdash;in fact I believe I am charged with
electricity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Charged with foolishness, you mean!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, but Mumsy, look, we are right behind
my cousins from Buck Hill. Let&#8217;s don&#8217;t go in
too close to them. I&#8217;m entirely too happy to
take a snubbing from Mildred Bucknor.
Doesn&#8217;t Cousin Ann Peyton look beautiful?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean the old lady in hoop skirts?
She&#8217;s terribly behind the times, ain&#8217;t she? But,
Judy, who was the young man who was so bent
on helping you out of the car? You didn&#8217;t
pretend to introduce him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Harbison. I have not met him myself
yet. I believe he is Mildred Bucknor&#8217;s special
property.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ten old men of the receiving line were
drawn up in battle array, in all the glory of
their best clothes. Pete Barnes was gorgeous
in checked trousers and Prince Albert coat, with
his bushy iron-gray hair well oiled and combed
in what used to be known as a roach, a style
popular in his early manhood. Some of the
veterans were in uniform&mdash;the blue or the
gray. All wore white carnations in their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
button-holes. The guests shook hands with the hosts
and then moved on. Those who had come
merely to look on sought the chairs ranged
against the wall; others who wanted to dance
were eagerly arranging for partners if they
were men, while the fair sex assumed a supreme
indifference. Colonel Crutcher busied himself
giving out dancing cards and seeing that the
young people were introduced.</p>
<p>The first sensation of the evening was the
entrance of Miss Ann Peyton. With slow
grace and dignity she sailed into the ballroom
and approached the receiving line alone. Mr.
and Mrs. Bucknor had stopped a moment to
speak to some acquaintances and Mildred had
intentionally held back the crowd of young
people comprising the house party from Buck
Hill, whispering that they really need not mix
with the others.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course we must speak to those ridiculous
old men, but after that we can just stay together.
It will be lots more fun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here comes Miss Ann Peyton!&#8221; the whisper
went around the hall.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if it isn&#8217;t Cousin Ann!&#8221; Big Josh
Bucknor boomed to his daughters.</p>
<p>&#8220;For goodness sake don&#8217;t ask her to go home
with us,&#8221; begged those ladies.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span></p>
<p>Big Josh slapped his leg and laughed aloud.
Everything about Big Josh was loud and
hearty. He was a short, fat man with a big,
red face and a perfectly bald head. The Misses
Bucknor were tall and aristocratic in figure and
bearing. They were constantly being mortified
by their father&#8217;s tendency to make a noise
and his unfailing habit of diverging from the
strict truth. But Big Josh was more popular
in the county than his conscientious daughters.</p>
<p>Old Billy had wormed his way into the ballroom
with the pretext of having to carry Miss
Ann&#8217;s shawl. Quietly he slipped up the stairs
into the balcony and, hiding behind the festooned
bunting, he peeped down on his beloved
mistress as she stood, a quaint, old-fashioned
figure, making her bow to the receiving line.</p>
<p>&#8220;By gad, Miss Ann, you are looking fit,&#8221;
said Major Fitch. &#8220;We are proud to have
you with us. I hope you will save me a dance.
Yes, yes! We are going to have some reels and
lancers and some good old time quadrilles. If
the young uns don&#8217;t like it they can lump it.
Here, Colonel Crutcher, give Miss Ann a
dance card. How about giving me the first
square dance?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And put me down for the next,&#8221; begged
the Colonel gallantly. &#8220;It won&#8217;t be the first
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
quadrille I have stepped with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>All down the line Miss Ann was greeted
with kindness and courtesy. Old Billy almost
fell out of the balcony, so great was his joy
when he saw Miss Ann&#8217;s card in demand and
realized that his mistress was being sought after.
A flush was on the old lady&#8217;s cheeks as she
swept across the ballroom floor and seated herself
in the outer row of chairs, reserved for the
dancers. A little titter arose.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a funny-looking old woman!&#8221; was
the general verdict.</p>
<p>&#8220;By the great jumping jingo, they shan&#8217;t
laugh at her!&#8221; exclaimed Big Josh. &#8220;She&#8217;s
kin&mdash;hoop skirt and all.&#8221;</p>
<p>His daughters held him back a moment:
&#8220;Remember! Don&#8217;t dare invite her home with
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Big Josh made a wry face but he immediately
went to speak to his aged cousin, looking
threateningly at the crowd who had dared to
giggle at anyone related to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you do, Cousin?&#8221; he said, pushing
her voluminous skirts aside so that he might
slide into the chair next to her. &#8220;Glad to see
you looking so spry. Thought we couldn&#8217;t
come to-night because the lane is so bad after
the rain this morning. Dust three feet deep
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
yesterday and to-day puddles big enough to
drown a pig. I&#8217;m gonter get me a flying machine.
Lots cheaper than trying to put that
road in condition. Yes&mdash;I&#8217;ll get a family
machine for the girls and a light little fly-by-night
for myself. I believe in the latest improvements
in everything.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I have flown often. Every time
I go to Louisville a friend takes me up. Not
afraid a bit&mdash;love it. Of course I know how
to run the motor&mdash;simplest thing in the world.
All you have to remember is not to sneeze while
you are up in the air. Sneezing is sometimes
fatal. It destroys your equilibrium as nothing
else does and you are liable to make a disastrous
nose dive. Running an airplane is much
easier than an automobile. Nerve? Not a bit
of it. I tell you, Cousin Ann, when I get my
flying machine I&#8217;ll come get you and ride you
to my place and then you will be spared the
bumps of that devilish lane. Just as soon as
I get it I&#8217;ll drop you a line. Of course, old
Billy can bring the carriage and horses up at
his convenience. You are at Buck Hill now, I
understand. I tell you, I&#8217;ll &#8217;phone over just
as soon as my airplane comes and you can get
yourself ready for a flight. Be sure to wrap up
warm and put something over your head.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span></p>
<p>Miss Ann assured him she would.</p>
<p>&#8220;By crickity! Who is that girl speaking to
the old men now? That red-headed girl in the
fairy queen dress? Bless Bob, if it ain&#8217;t old
Dick Buck&#8217;s granddaughter. I used to give
her a lift into school when she was a kid. I
tell you she&#8217;s got some style about her. Looks
more born and bred than any gal here. I don&#8217;t
see where she got it from.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;From the Bucknors!&#8221; announced Miss Ann,
firmly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bucknors! Oh, come now, Cousin Ann, you
aren&#8217;t going to come that old gag on me. Old
Dick Buck used to boast he was our kin when
he got drunk, but it is absurd. Drunk or sober,
he was no relation of ours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was your cousin, both drunk and sober.
I&#8217;ve heard my grandfather tell&mdash;&#8221; and Miss
Ann launched into the tale.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, by gad, if she&#8217;s of the blood we ought
to recognize her!&#8221; declared Big Josh, smiting
his thigh with a resounding smack. &#8220;I&#8217;ll speak
to the family about it. Little Josh will be here
to-night and Cousin Betty Throckmorton&#8217;s
Philip and no doubt many of the clan. I
tell you I wouldn&#8217;t mind claiming kin with a
gal like that, especially now that old Dick Buck
is dead.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>On With the Dance</h3>
</div>
<p>Others besides Big Josh had noticed Judith as
she came forward to speak to her old friends.
Her dress, a shimmer of white and gold, might
have been wished on her by a fairy godmother,
a thing of gossamer and moonbeams.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who can it be?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody but little Judy Buck, you say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did she get her clothes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Worked like a nigger and bought &#8217;em!
Why not? She&#8217;s the best little worker in town.
Got a bunch of irons in the fire and she surely
ought to get some clothes out of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But old Dick Buck&#8217;s granddaughter&#8217;s got
no right to be mixing with county society.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Knights were a good sort and Dick
wasn&#8217;t anything but lazy and trifling and sometimes
a little tipsy. There wasn&#8217;t anything
mean about old Dick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, she&#8217;s a humdinger for looks, is all
I&#8217;ve got to say.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span></p>
<p>So the talk went around. Judith, all unconscious
of having attracted attention, shook hands
gaily with the old men and all but kissed them
in her joy, and promised to dance with every
one of them and immediately had her card filled
with trembly-looking autographs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you dance, Mrs. Buck?&#8221; suggested
Colonel Crutcher, but Mrs. Buck declined with
agitated blushes, declaring her health was too
feeble for such carryings-on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m going to put you in a front seat
so you won&#8217;t miss anything and then Miss Judy
can sit by you when she is not dancing. That&#8217;s
all right, I&#8217;ll get some of your church members
to keep you company.&#8221;</p>
<p>Colonel Crutcher conducted mother and
daughter across the ballroom and, much to the
confusion of Mrs. Buck, placed them next to
Miss Ann Peyton. That lady was seated in
solitary grandeur, Big Josh having departed to
look up other members of the family.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Peyton, this is a little friend of mine
I want to introduce to you, Miss Judith Buck,
and her mother, Mrs. Buck.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Ann bowed with what might be called
gracious stiffness, and moved her skirts a fraction
of an inch to make room for Judith.</p>
<p>Mrs. Buck was thankful that some church
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
friends were found by whom she might sit and
be as inconspicuous as possible. She would
have been frightened beyond words if she had
been forced to sit by Miss Ann Peyton. Not so
Judith! The girl looked levelly into the old
woman&#8217;s eyes and then sat down.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to thank you for the toilet water
you sent to me by my servant. It was very
kind of you,&#8221; said Miss Ann.</p>
<p>&#8220;I loved to do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Perhaps because ever since
I was a tiny little girl I have watched you go
driving by on the pike and I&#8217;ve always wanted
to give you a present. Sometimes I used to
pick flowers and hide behind the fence, thinking
maybe I could stop your carriage and give them
to you, but I was too shy, and old Billy always
looked so fierce&mdash;as though he were taking the
Queen to Windsor. But I used to make up
stories about you and your coach and now I
am too big and old to make up silly stories and
no longer shy and hiding behind hedges, but I
kind of felt that the toilet water might be the
essence of the flowers I used to pick for you
when I was a little girl&mdash;the ones you never
got.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, indeed!&#8221; was all Miss Ann said, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
she sought the girl&#8217;s hand and held it a moment
in the folds of her billowing lace dress.</p>
<p>Then the music started and the ball had begun
and Major Fitch was bowing low in front of
Miss Ann, claiming the first quadrille, and
Colonel Crutcher was holding out his hands for
Judith.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dance in the set with me,&#8221; Miss Ann whispered
to Judith, as though they were girls together.</p>
<p>Of course nobody dances quadrilles in these
jazz days, but the old men had stipulated that
the band from Louisville must know how to
play for quadrille and lancers and dusty old
music had been unearthed and now the ball was
opened with an old-fashioned quadrille, with
Pete Barnes calling the figures with the gusto
of one practiced in the art.</p>
<p>&#8220;Swing your partner! Balance all! Swing
the corners! Ladies change! Sashay all! First
couple to the right, bow and swing! Second
couple to the right&mdash;do the same thing! Bow
and swing! Bow and swing! Third couple to
the right&mdash;do the same thing! Bow and
swing! Bow and swing! Right and left all
around&mdash;bow to your partner! Promenade
all!&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Ann and her partner glided and dipped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
and bowed, Miss Ann tripping and mincing and
Major Fitch pointing his toes and crooking his
elbows with much elegance and occasionally taking
fancy steps to the edification of all beholders.</p>
<p>Judith gave herself up to the dance with
abandon. The music took possession of her and
she swayed and rocked to its beat and cut pigeon
wings with Colonel Crutcher, much to the delight
of that veteran. She smiled at Miss Ann
and Miss Ann smiled at her as Pete Barnes
called, &#8220;Ladies change.&#8221; They squeezed hands
as they passed and Judith whispered, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t
it lovely?&#8221; and Miss Ann murmured,
&#8220;Lovely!&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no doubt about it that the set in
which Miss Ann and Judith was dancing was
the popular one. The spectators moved to that
end of the hall and when the dancers indulged
in any particularly graceful steps they were applauded.
Old Billy crept from the balcony and
hid himself behind a palm, where he could look
out on his beloved mistress and declare to himself
over and over, &#8220;She am the pick er the
bunch.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeff Bucknor, although he had resolved to
give the evening up to making his sisters&#8217;
friends enjoy themselves, found himself taken
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
up with watching Judith Buck. He had fully
intended to ask Jean Roland to dance the first
dance with him, but had seen her led forth by
the fat boy without once offering a rescuing
hand. While the quadrille was being danced he
stood by a window and looked on. As soon as
the quadrille was over he hurried to Judith&#8217;s
side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please let me have the next dance, Miss
Buck.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe I have an engagement,&#8221; panted
Judith, looking at her card. &#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s a waltz
and dear old Mr. Pete Barnes has put his name
down. See!&#8221; She held it up for Jeff&#8217;s inspection.
Pete had written, &#8220;Set this dance out
with your true admirer, Pete Barnes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense,&#8221; cried Jeff. &#8220;You mustn&#8217;t sit
out dances with old men when young men are
dy&mdash;want to dance with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mustn&#8217;t I though? Not when old men have
been good to me beyond belief? These are my
old men and I wouldn&#8217;t break an engagement
with one of them for a pretty. Mr. Pete Barnes
had a sabre cut once that made him a little lame
and he can&#8217;t dance, so I promised to sit out
the waltz with him,&#8221; explained Judith.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, then the next dance on your
card!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That is with Major Fitch and the next with
Judge Middleton&mdash;that&#8217;s the Lancers&mdash;then
the Virgina Reel with old Captain Crump. I&#8217;m
very sorry, but I believe I am booked up until
the intermission, which I hope means supper.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t mean you are going to give up
the whole evening to those old fellows. Miss
Buck, Judith! Yes, I have a perfect right to
call you Judith. You are my cousin. I&mdash;I&mdash;just
found it out the other day. In fact, I am
your nearest male relative,&#8221; Jeff said whimsically,
&#8220;and as such I forbid you to spend
the whole evening wasting your sweetness on the
old men. They may be very fine old chaps,
but&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;May be! But! There is no maybe and no
but about it. They are the loveliest old men
in the world. You got to be a cousin too suddenly,
Mr. Bucknor. Kinship is something
deeper than a sudden flare. The old men are
my fairy godfathers and that is closer than
forty-eleventh cousins. Why, they even gave
me my lovely dress so I could come to the
ball. No, Mr. Barnes, I haven&#8217;t forgotten,&#8221;
she said, tucking her hand in the old man&#8217;s arm
as he came up to claim her promise. She looked
over her shoulder and laughed at Jeff Bucknor.
&#8220;Good-bye, Cousin!&#8221; she called.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span></p>
<p>Jeff moodily sought refuge behind Cousin
Ann&#8217;s draperies. He knew he was behaving
rudely, not to dance with the girls of the house
party. He was sure Mildred and Nan would
berate him, but he felt as though there were
weights on his feet. Miss Ann graciously
made room for him.</p>
<p>&#8220;A very charming ball, Cousin,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why are you not dancing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody to dance with&mdash;unless you will
favor me,&#8221; he added gallantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, my dear cousin, I have danced once to-night
and I am afraid I had better not venture
again. I am very fatigued from the unwonted
exertion.&#8221; Indeed, the old lady did look tired,
although very happy and contented. &#8220;Why do
you not endeavor to engage my charming vis-a-vis?
I see she is not dancing either.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph! She has given me to understand
she preferred talking to old Pete Barnes to
dancing with me. She&#8217;s a strange girl, Cousin
Ann, and I can&#8217;t make her out.&#8221;</p>
<p>At least Jeff had the satisfaction of seeing
Judith refuse to dance with Tom Harbison.
That young man had crossed the floor with
his accustomed assurance, had bowed low in
front of Judith and begged her to favor him,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
even taking her by the hand and endeavoring
to draw her from her chair, but she had refused
him in short order.</p>
<p>Judith danced and danced with the old men.
Whatever the step they decided to take the
girl followed. She was a born dancer and, after
a few paces, could adapt herself to any partner.
There were other young men besides Jeff
and Tom who sought her hand in the dance,
but she was always engaged to some one of
the ten old men. The only chance for the young
ones was for the old ones to fall by the wayside,
which they did occasionally when their old
legs refused to carry them farther.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d break in on them if they weren&#8217;t so old,&#8221;
declared one young farmer.</p>
<p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t do a bit of good,&#8221; said a young
doctor. &#8220;I tried and she turned me down&mdash;said
she had promised the old duffer the whole
dance.&#8221;</p>
<p>So it happened that Judith&#8217;s time was fully
taken up by her fairy godfathers until the
supper-time intermission.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>Cinderella Revealed</h3>
</div>
<p>The rattle of china and silver had begun in
a room beyond the dancing hall and an aroma
of coffee and a suggestion of savory food was
in the air. Dancers and spectators sniffed in
anticipation. The music stopped. Judge Middleton
walked towards the end of the hall. He
had Judith Buck by his side, her hand resting
lightly on his arm. She was chatting gaily, but
the Judge looked rather serious.</p>
<p>When the couple reached a spot near the
bass drum, the Judge stopped and, borrowing
the stick from the musician, he rapped sharply
on the side of the drum.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s going to make a speech!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Be quiet!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Judge Middleton is going to talk!&#8221;</p>
<p>The other nine old men called for order.
Another sharp rap on the drum and all was
still.</p>
<p>&#8220;Friends,&#8221; the Judge said, &#8220;I have something
to say to you.&#8221; One could have heard
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
a pin drop. &#8220;Of course all of us old men know
that you have had a very good time, laughing at
us because we sent out invitations calling this a
debut party. We are pleased to have given so
many of our friends a good laugh. We did it
on purpose, because we have all of us lived a
long time and we know how popular it makes
you to furnish a good laugh. We are proud
and happy that so many persons have seen fit
to come to our party and we hope you are having
a pleasant time to repay you for your
trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hear! Hear!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The best this year!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do it again!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if any of you noticed that our
invitation did not say to whom we were giving
this debut party? We left that out on purpose,
because we were afraid it might scare off the
person whom we are delighted to honor. Up
to this moment the dear child whose debut party
this is has been entirely ignorant that it is
hers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Judith, who had been standing by her old
friend, utterly unconscious of self, wholly absorbed
in his speech, now looked at him with an
expression of startled amazement. She gave
a little gasp and blushed violently.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Friends of Ryeville and our county, we, the
old men of the neighborhood, wish to tell you
that this debut ball is in honor of our fairy
godchild, Miss Judith Buck.&#8221;</p>
<p>A ripple of applause ran around the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know that we are not doing the conventional
thing in the conventional way,&#8221; the
Judge continued, &#8220;but we wanted to do something
different for a girl who is different. Only
a few days ago we were sitting, talking, discussing
matters and things, when the thought came
to us that we should like to do something for a
girl who has never been too busy to stop and
have a pleasant word with us old men. It was
my friend, Pete Barnes, who thought of this
way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, my idee, my idee!&#8221; cried Pete.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure a great many of you already
know our young friend. You have seen her
grow from childhood to young womanhood&mdash;watched
her trudging in to school in all weathers,
determined to get an education at any cost&mdash;noted
her record at school, always at the top or
near the top. Perhaps others in Ryeville besides
the old men have been cheered by her
happy face and ready wit and sympathy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hear! Hear!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And now we old men wish to present formally
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
to society Miss Judith Buck. If you have
any criticism to make of our method, please
blame us and not our guest of honor. This is a
surprise party for her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I call that right down pretty,&#8221; said
Big Josh to his Cousin Bob. &#8220;I have been wanting
all evening to get in a word with some of
the crowd concerning this young lady, but it
looks like it&#8217;s hard to get away from the women
folk long enough to talk sense.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe I know what you mean,&#8221; said Mr.
Bucknor uneasily. &#8220;It won&#8217;t do, Josh, it won&#8217;t
do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The dickens it won&#8217;t do, if we decide to
claim her!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But the ladies, Josh, the ladies! I fancy
Cousin Ann has told you what she told me. The
tale got my madam and the girls up in arms
and I can&#8217;t cope with the whole biling of them.
I&#8217;d say no more about it if I were you. Of
course we must go up and shake hands with the
girl, and do the polite, but the least said the
soonest mended&mdash;about her being related to us.
You know well enough if the women folk are
opposed it would be harder on the girl than just
letting the matter drop right where it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I reckon I can control the ladies in my
family,&#8221; blustered Big Josh.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Ahem!&#8221; said Mr. Bob Bucknor, with a significant
glance at his cousin, &#8220;I must confess that
I can&#8217;t always do so. I find that entertaining
Cousin Ann Peyton, for months at a time, is
about all I can do in the way of coercion where
the ladies of my family are concerned.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to relieve you of that burden,
Bob,&#8221; declared Big Josh. &#8220;I fully realize you
have had more than your share lately, but the
truth of the matter is my lane is in mighty bad
shape here lately. I have just been talking to
Cousin Ann about coming to us for a spell. In
fact, I&#8217;ve been telling her I&#8217;d come and fetch
her before so very long.&#8221;</p>
<p>Judith stood demurely between Judge Middleton
and Major Fitch and made her bow to Ryeville
society. They had asked Mrs. Buck to
stand by her daughter, but that lady begged to
be excused.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just a private person,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and it
would flustrate me so I&#8217;d be sure to have one of
my attacks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Everybody went up and shook hands with the
guest of honor&mdash;even Mildred Bucknor, although
she did not enjoy it at all.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is the silliest thing I ever saw in my life,&#8221;
she declared. &#8220;As though that Judith Buck
wasn&#8217;t forward enough as it is, without those
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
ridiculous old men forcing her on people this
way. If we had known the party was given
to her, we never should have come, but now
that we are here we naturally must behave as
gentle folk and be decent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; echoed Nan. &#8220;We couldn&#8217;t
leave just as supper is announced either. That
would be impolite.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very!&#8221; said the fat boy.</p>
<p>The knowledge that the debut party was
given to little Judith Buck in no way served to
throw a damper on the festivities. On the contrary,
the gaiety of the guests increased. Supper
was a decided success and the stylish waiters
from Louisville saw to it that everyone was
served bountifully. Old Billy crept from behind
the decorations and insisted upon waiting
on his mistress.</p>
<p>&#8220;She am the queen er the ball,&#8221; he said arrogantly
to the young darkey who objected to
giving up his tray to the old man.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean the young lady who&#8217;s havin&#8217; her
comin&#8217; out?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t mean her, but my Miss Ann,
who air a settin&#8217; over yonder all kivered with
di&#8217;ments.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Ann was weary and tremulous. She
had been strangely moved by Judge Middleton&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
speech. Why, she did not know exactly,
but all evening she had been putting herself in
Judith&#8217;s place, wondering what life would have
held for her if at the turning point she had
shown the character and spunk of this young
girl. She had gone with the rest to shake hands
with the girl after Judge Middleton&#8217;s speech.
She longed to declare their relationship, but was
afraid to until the family accepted Judith. So
Miss Ann merely took Judith&#8217;s hand in hers
and pressed it gently. All she said was, &#8220;I
am so happy to have met you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, thank you, Miss Peyton. I am indeed
glad to know you.&#8221; Judith had almost called
her cousin. She devoutly hoped nobody had
noticed it, but there was no time for repinings
because one was stand-offish. Too many persons
must be introduced to the debutante. Even
had Mildred Bucknor been inclined to chat with
her former schoolmate she would not have been
allowed to do it. There were others who pressed
forward to greet the fairy godchild of the old
men of Ryeville.</p>
<p>The general attitude of the assembly was good
natured and congratulatory. The aristocratic
contingent was inclined to be a little formal,
but polite and not unkindly. The aristocrats
were more or less related to one another, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
most of them were connected, closely or distantly,
with the Bucknors. Their formality in
greeting Judith might easily have been accounted
for by the fact that Big Josh Bucknor
had kept the ball rolling in regard to old Dick
Buck&#8217;s kinship with the family. From the
moment Miss Ann Peyton had made the statement
that the Bucks and Bucknors were originally
the same people, Big Josh had been
spreading the news. All of them had heard it
before, but nobody had ever given serious
thought to it. To be related to slovenly, lazy,
dissipated old Dick Buck was out of the question.
The possibility of such a connection was
laughably preposterous. It was quite a different
matter, however, to contemplate receiving
into the charmed circle a beautiful young girl
who was everything her unworthy old grandparent
had not been.</p>
<p>&#8220;But we must go slowly,&#8221; Little Josh Bucknor
had said, when approached by his cousin,
Big Josh. &#8220;It&#8217;s a great deal easier to get relations
than it is to get rid of them. Ahem&mdash;Cousin
Ann, for instance! Cousin Ann is so
distantly related to us that one cannot trace
the kinship, but we got started wrong with her
in old days and now you would think she was
as close as a mother or something.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m mighty bothered about Cousin Ann, Big
Josh. The fact of the matter is, my wife won&#8217;t
stand for her. I can&#8217;t even make her go up and
speak to the old lady. She&#8217;s been talking to
Cousin Betty Throckmorton and they&#8217;ve been
hatching up a scheme to freeze out Cousin Ann
and fix it so she&#8217;ll have to go to an old ladies&#8217;
home. Cousin Mildred Bucknor is in on it, too,
and from the way they&#8217;ve had their heads together
all evening I believe your daughters are
in the plot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The minxes! I don&#8217;t doubt it. Poor Cousin
Ann! She&#8217;s never done anybody any harm in
her life,&#8221; and Big Josh&#8217;s round, moon-like face
expressed as much sorrow as it was capable of.</p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;never any harm&mdash;but I reckon
Cousin Ann hasn&#8217;t done much good in her time.
When you come right down to it, chronic visiting
is a poor way to spend your time, unless
you are a powerful good visitor, which Cousin
Ann isn&#8217;t. She got started wrong and never
has got put on the right road. I don&#8217;t see what
we are going to do about it. Bob Bucknor is
having more than his share, but I can&#8217;t do a
thing with my wife. You see, she made her
own living before she married me and she&#8217;s got
no use for what she calls the unproductive consumer.
She says that&#8217;s what Cousin Ann is.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
Mrs. Bob is getting worn out with it, too, because
her girls are grown now and they are
kicking at having the poor old lady come down
on them on all occasions. It looks as though
we&#8217;d have to call a meeting of the family and
thresh the thing out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Little Josh, who had acquired the diminutive
title merely because he had been born two years
later than his cousin, Big Josh, showed despondency
in every line of his six-feet-two.</p>
<p>&#8220;The women will all be banded against her
and want to send her to a home, but we can&#8217;t
stand for that,&#8221; said Big Josh. &#8220;The women&#8217;ll
have to get it into their heads that they can&#8217;t
boss the whole shooting match. Well, come on
and let&#8217;s speak to our little cousin. Oh, you
needn&#8217;t worry. I&#8217;m going to be as careful as
possible and never say a word I shouldn&#8217;t. I
can&#8217;t take her into the family unless all the
others do. When we have the family meeting
about Cousin Ann we might bring up this business
of Miss Judith Buck at the same time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good idea! Good idea!&#8221; agreed Little
Josh.</p>
<p>What Big Josh said to Judith was, &#8220;And
how do you do, Miss Buck? Remember you?
Of course I remember you, but do you remember
me?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And how could I forget you when you
have given me many a lift on the road? You
never passed me by without picking me up.&#8221;
Judith&#8217;s manner was so frank and sweet and
she smiled so brightly at Big Josh, returning
his vigorous handshake with a strong, unaffected
clasp, that the good-natured fellow was won
over completely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well! We&#8217;ve pretty near got the
same name,&#8221; he cried heartily. &#8220;You are Buck
and I am Bucknor. I wouldn&#8217;t be astonished
if we had been the same in the beginning.
Either your folks knocked the <i>nor</i> off or my
folks stuck it on. Ha! Ha! We may be related
for all we know.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>The Morning After</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;All over and paid for!&#8221; yawned Colonel
Crutcher the morning after the debut party.
&#8220;I tell you I couldn&#8217;t do it every night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Neither could I&mdash;nor every week, nor every
month, nor even every year,&#8221; agreed Major
Fitch. &#8220;But I tell you, Crutcher, it was worth
it, I mean digging in our jeans for the money
and getting so tired out and feeling our age
and everything. It was worth it all, just to
see our girl&#8217;s eyes shining and to prove what
she is made of. I tell you she stood up there
and received with as much dignity as Queen
Victoria herself.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old men were gathered together on the
Rye House porch, chairs tilted back and feet
on railing as usual.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you, she&#8217;s a thoroughbred, all right,&#8221;
declared Pete Barnes. &#8220;Why, that gal turned
down two of the best-looking beaux at the hop&mdash;Jeff
Bucknor and that young Harbison&mdash;just
to sit down an&#8217; talk with me, old Pete
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
Barnes. Jeff Bucknor was sore, too. He up
an&#8217; claimed kin with her an&#8217; she just gave him
the merry ha ha.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, my j&#8217;ints are mighty stiff, but I&#8217;m
proud to have trod a measure with Miss Judith
Buck,&#8221; said Colonel Crutcher.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was worth a lot to see Miss Ann Peyton
again, too,&#8221; said Judge Middleton. &#8220;I heard a
good deal of talk on the side about Miss Ann
last night. It seems that the family is getting
together on the subject. The women folks are
reading the riot act and simply refusing to
have the old lady visit them any more. Big
Josh was shooting off his lip pretty lively because
the women of the family want to send her
to an old ladies&#8217; home. I say poor Miss Ann,
but at the same time I can see the other side.&#8221;</p>
<p>Others beside the old men were aweary after
the ball. Miss Ann spent a sleepless night and
could not drag herself from her bed in time
for breakfast. When old Billy came to her
room with a can of hot water for her morning
ablutions, he found his mistress limp and forlorn.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jes&#8217; you lay still, my pretty, an&#8217; ol&#8217; Billy
will bring you up some breakfus&#8217;. You had so
many beaux las&#8217; night, hoverin&#8217; roun&#8217; you like
bees &#8217;roun&#8217; a honey pot, no wonder you air
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
tuckered out this mornin&#8217;. I reckon you couldn&#8217;t
sleep with yo&#8217; haid so full er music an&#8217; carryin&#8217;s
on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t sleep very well, Billy, because I am
worrying. I am thinking perhaps we had better
move on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say it, Miss Ann, don&#8217;t say it! Buck
Hill air sho&#8217; the gyardin spot er all our visitations.
What put you in min&#8217; er movin&#8217; on?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I overheard, without meaning to in the
least, but they spoke quite loudly&mdash;I overheard
Cousin Milly talking on the subject with some
of the others at the ball and I am afraid we
are not welcome here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Miss Ann, &#8217;twas only yistiddy that
young Marse Jeff Bucknor up an&#8217; made me a
solemn promise that you wouldn&#8217;t never want
fer nothin&#8217; so long as he mought live an&#8217; be
able ter do fer you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s very sweet of him, Billy, but this
isn&#8217;t his home alone. His mother is the mistress
here. I think we might go visit Mr. Big Josh
Bucknor for a while. He was very cordial and
even said he would come for me in a flying machine
because of the bad road leading into his
place. What do you think of that, Billy? He
said you could follow after with the carriage and
horses.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Miss Ann, I think Marse Big Josh
air as good as gol&#8217; an&#8217; as kind as custard, but
I can&#8217;t help a feelin&#8217; that he don&#8217;t mean ev&#8217;y-thing
he says. Not that he ain&#8217;t a thinkin&#8217; at
the time that he will do what he promises, but
ev&#8217;ybody knows you have ter take what Marse
Big Josh says with a dose of salts. I don&#8217;t
mean he wouldn&#8217;t be proud an&#8217; glad ter have
us-alls come an&#8217; visit him, but I mean he ain&#8217;t
liable ter be a flyin&#8217; any time soon er late in this
here world er yet the world ter come. He ain&#8217;t
ter say sanctified.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll stay on here a while longer
then, Billy, but far be it from me to have it
said we had worn out our welcome.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Miss Ann, that there ain&#8217;t possible
here at Buck Hill. The house pawty air a
breakin&#8217; up this day an&#8217; mo&#8217;n likely the gues&#8217;
chamber will be returned to its rightful habitant.
You mus&#8217; a hearn wrong &#8217;bout Miss Milly not
wantin&#8217; you. Miss Milly&#8217;s all time stoppin&#8217;
an&#8217; tellin&#8217; me how proud she air ter have you
here under her roof an&#8217; how glad she air ter
have sech a zample as you fer her gals ter foller
in the footsteps er &#8217;portment an&#8217; &#8217;havior. An&#8217;
Marse Bob air continuously singin&#8217; yo&#8217; praises.
I hearn him tellin&#8217; Mr. Philip Throckmorton
las&#8217; night that you were a gues&#8217; it wa&#8217; his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
delight ter honor. An&#8217; Mr. Philip Throckmorton
said as how as soon as he had a home er his
own you would be the fust pusson ter occupew
his gues&#8217; chamber. An&#8217; then Mr. Little Josh he
said how noble an&#8217; &#8217;stinguished you were an&#8217;
s&#8217;perior. I tell you, Miss Ann, these here folks
air all proud er bein&#8217; yo&#8217; kin. They&#8217;s all quarrelin&#8217;
&#8217;bout whar you air gonter visit nex&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus the old man soothed her troubled spirit
and lulled it into a semblance of repose. At any
rate it was easier to pretend that she believed
him. At least it made him happy, and in pretending
she almost persuaded herself that her
kinsmen were glad and anxious to have her. She
drank the coffee her old servant brought her and
settled herself for a morning of rest, although
the house was buzzing with the breaking up of
the house party.</p>
<p>The young people, too, were feeling the effect
of last night&#8217;s dissipation. The ball was not
over at twelve o&#8217;clock, as the invitations had intimated
it would be, but had gone on into the
wee small hours of morning. It was not often
that Ryeville had the chance to trip the light
fantastic toe to the music of a Louisville band
and the eager dancers had begged for more and
more. The old people had dropped out, one by
one, but the youngsters danced on and on.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span></p>
<p>Then it was that Judith had come into her
own as it were, and all of the young men who
had been denied before supper seemed determined
to make up for lost time. The most persistent
of the clamoring swains were Jeff Bucknor
and Tom Harbison. This popularity of a
person who had always rubbed her the wrong
way was wormwood to Mildred Bucknor, and
for her brother and Tom Harbison to be rivals
for Judith&#8217;s favor added gall to the wormwood.
Not that Mildred was not having a very good
time herself. Indeed, she was always something
of a belle and never lacked for partners, but she
had other plans for her brother on the one hand
and on the other Tom Harbison had paid her
enough attention for her to consider him in a
measure her property. She had even announced
to several of her friends, in the strictest confidence,
that she was engaged to him&mdash;or &#8220;as
good as engaged.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ball of the night before was under discussion
at the breakfast table. It was pronounced,
on the whole, to have been a very good
ball and a fitting climax to the house party.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course it is perfectly absurd for the old
men to think they can put that Buck girl into
society by merely giving her a debut party,&#8221;
said Mildred. &#8220;It takes something besides good
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
clothes and an introduction to place people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How about beauty and intelligence and
character?&#8221; asked Jeff.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, tastes differ as to beauty, and if she
had any sense she would know enough not to
try to push herself where she isn&#8217;t wanted. I
don&#8217;t think it is indicative of a very good character
to accept clothes from a man. I heard, on
very good authority, that a man gave her her
dress. He paid a pretty penny for it, too, I am
sure. Nan and I looked at some gowns like
hers when we were in Louisville and they were
too steep for us, I can tell you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know about the dress. She told me,&#8221; said
Jeff.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, things have progressed pretty far with
you,&#8221; sneered his sister. &#8220;Perhaps she was letting
you know she was by way of receiving gifts
of such a character from her admirers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeff couldn&#8217;t trust himself to speak calmly in
rebuttal of Mildred&#8217;s accusations and so he left
the room. One thing he had determined, and
that was to cut his time of recreation short and
knuckle down to the practice of law immediately.
A spirit of antagonism was developing between
brother and sister that greatly distressed Jeff.
He had no doubt that he was somewhat to
blame, but at the same time Mildred was spoiled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
and petulant and overbearing. He doubted her
kindness of heart, too, since he had witnessed
her cruelty in regard to Cousin Ann Peyton and
Judith Buck. He also decided to try a hazard
of new fortunes in Louisville rather than Ryeville
as his family had planned.</p>
<p>Jeff was glad that the house party was breaking
up. Perhaps now Buck Hill would settle
down into peace and quiet and he would have
a chance to discuss his affairs with his father
and mother. He was glad that he would no
longer be called upon to do the impossible&mdash;to
fall in love with the dark beauty, Jean Roland,
when for days and nights, in his mind&#8217;s eye, was
ever the picture of a fair girl with a halo of
red-gold hair. He was glad, too, that the
obnoxious Tom Harbison would be leaving. It
was only lately that he had felt Tom to be
obnoxious. If Harbison was in love with Mildred,
as he had been led to believe was the case,
what right had he to be so persistent in his
attentions to Judith? Well, at any rate he was
leaving the county and would have no more
chance to hover around the girl. Any hovering
that was done Jeff was determined to do himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have seen this girl but four times in
all, unless I can count those times when she was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
a little, barefooted kid selling blackberries and
I was such a fool I couldn&#8217;t understand what
she was to grow to be, and still I&#8217;m as sure as
I shall ever be of anything in my life that she
is the only girl for me.&#8221; Thus he mused after
he had left the room rather than listen to his
sister&#8217;s gossip. He was standing on the porch,
looking through the trees at the garden beyond,
and thinking what an appropriate background
it would be for Judith&#8217;s rare beauty. How he
would like to lead her through the box maze
and then sit beside her on the marble bench
under the syringa bushes! If he could prevail
upon the independent girl to listen to him,
would his family receive her? Would it not be
best for all concerned if he could forget Judith?
Anyhow, he would not try to see her again, and
he would soon be settled in Louisville, making
only occasional visits home. Life looked dreary
to Jeff.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>Uncle Billy Makes a Call</h3>
</div>
<p>Judith and her mother were also the victims
of the morning after. Mrs. Buck was pale and
listless, complaining of shortness of breath,
while Judith felt it impossible to accomplish the
many duties she had planned for Saturday
forenoon.</p>
<p>&#8220;The truth of the matter is I can&#8217;t stop
dancing. If I only had some quick music I
could work to it. I wonder if Cinderella swept
the hearth clean the morning after the ball.
Mumsy, do you think the prince was there last
night?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Prince! What prince?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, just any old prince! Prince Charming!
I think&mdash;in fact I am sure&mdash;I liked my
Cousin Jeff Bucknor better than any of the
men who danced with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Judith, please don&#8217;t start up that
foolishness. Jeff Bucknor may dance with you
because everybody else wanted to, but he would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
be very much astonished if he heard you calling
him cousin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he heard me last night, but he started
it. He wanted to boss me, because he said he
was my nearest of kin. I just laughed at him
and called out, &#8216;Good-bye, Cousin!&#8217; Mr. Big
Josh Bucknor almost claimed kin with me, too.
Wouldn&#8217;t it be funny, Mumsy, if all of them
got to doing it? It would be kind of nice to
have some kinfolks who knew they were kin.
I know you think I am conceited, but somehow
I believe the men would be more pleased about
it than the women. Maybe the women are
afraid I&#8217;d take to visiting them like poor Cousin
Ann!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph! Cousin Ann indeed!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Mumsy, she was real cousinish last
night. There was a look in her eyes that made
me feel that she was almost claiming relationship.
She squeezed my hand in the quadrille,
and when she came up to speak to me after the
darling old men let the cat out of the bag about
its being my debut party she was very near to
kissing me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t hold much to kissing
strangers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mother and daughter were on the side porch,
engaged in various household duties, while this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
desultory discussion was going on. Suddenly
there appeared at the corner of the house old
Uncle Billy. In his hand he carried a small
package wrapped in newspaper. He bowed
and bowed, wagging his head like a mechanical
toy.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mus&#8217; &#8217;scuse me, ladies, fer a walkin&#8217;
up on you &#8217;thout no warnin&#8217;, but I got a little
comin&#8217; out gif fer the young lady, if she don&#8217;t
think ol&#8217; Billy air too bold an&#8217; resumtious. It
air jes&#8217; a bit er jewilry what air been, so&#8217;s ter
speak, in my fambly fer goin&#8217; on a hun&#8217;erd or
so years. Ol&#8217; Mis, the gran&#8217;maw er my Miss
Ann&mdash;Miss Elizabeth Bucknor as was&mdash;gib
it to ter my mammy fer faithfulness in time er
stress. It were when smallpox done laid low
the white folks an&#8217; my mammy nuss &#8217;em though
the trouble when ev&#8217;ybody, white and black, wa&#8217;
so scairt they runned off an&#8217; hid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Uncle Billy, I think you are too
lovely to give it to me. But you ought to
keep it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it ain&#8217;t ever been much use ter me,
seein&#8217; as I can&#8217;t wear a locket, but I reckon
you mought hang it roun&#8217; yo&#8217; putty neck sometime.&#8221;</p>
<p>He took off the newspaper wrapping, disclosing
a flat velvet box much rubbed and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
soiled. Touching a spring the lid flew open,
disclosing a large cameo of rare and intricate
workmanship, with a gold filigree border and
gold back.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like ter give it ter you, if you won&#8217;t be
a thinkin&#8217; it&#8217;s free-niggerish of me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I think it is perfectly lovely of you.
It is a beautiful locket&mdash;the most beautiful I
ever saw. See, Mumsy, I can put it on my
little gold chain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No doubt!&#8221; Mrs. Buck looked distrustfully
at Billy, but the old man held himself so meekly
and his manner was so respectful that her heart
was somewhat softened.</p>
<p>&#8220;You sho&#8217; air got a pleasant place here. I
allus been holdin&#8217; th&#8217;ain&#8217;t no place so peaceful
an&#8217; homelike as a shady side po&#8217;ch, with plenty
er scrubbery an&#8217; chickens a scratchin&#8217; under &#8217;em.
I&#8217;d be proud to have a po&#8217;ch er my own, with
a box er portulac a bloomin&#8217; in front er it an&#8217;
plenty er nice red jewraniums sproutin&#8217; &#8217;roun&#8217;
in ol&#8217; mattersies cans&mdash;but, you see, me&#8217;n Miss
Ann air allus on the jump&mdash;what with all the
invites we gits ter visitate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me show you what a nice vegetable
garden I have planted, Uncle Billy, and what
a lovely well we have, with the coldest water in
the county. Maybe you would like a drink of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
cold water, or perhaps you would like some
fresh buttermilk. I have just churned and the
buttermilk is splendid,&#8221; said Judith.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thankee, thankee kindly, missy! I&#8217;s a
great han&#8217; fo&#8217; buttermilk.&#8221; The old man followed
Judith to the dairy and watched with
admiring eyes as she dipped the creamy beverage
from the great stone jar and poured it into
a big glass mug.</p>
<p>&#8220;This was Grandfather Buck&#8217;s mug. He
liked to drink buttermilk from it, but he always
called it a schooner. That was his house, back
there. He never lived in it after Grandfather
Knight died, so my mother tells me, but we
always have called it his house. It still has his
furniture in it, but nobody stays there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hearn my Miss Ann a talkin&#8217; bout yo&#8217;
fambly not so long ago. She say the Bucks
an&#8217; Bucknors were one an&#8217; the same in days
gone by but one er yo&#8217; forebears done mislaid
the tail en&#8217; of his name. But Miss Ann say
that don&#8217;t make no mind ter her&mdash;that you is
of one blood jes&#8217; the same. She even done up
an&#8217; state that you air as clost kin ter her as the
Buck Hill folks air. She air allus been a gret
han&#8217; for geology an&#8217; tracin&#8217; back whar folks
comed from.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&mdash;she didn&#8217;t tell you to tell me that,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
did she, Uncle Billy?&#8221; Judith looked piercingly
at the old man. He tried to say Miss
Ann knew he was going to tell the girl of their
kinship but her clear gaze confused him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well, no&#8217;m, she didn&#8217;t &#8217;zactly tell me,
but&mdash;No&#8217;m, she don&#8217;t even know I done come
a&#8217; callin&#8217;. She jes&#8217; thinks I&#8217;m out a exercisin&#8217;
of Puck an&#8217; Coopid. Them&#8217;s the names er my
hosses.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps she would not like your telling me
this,&#8221; persisted Judith.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, missy, if you ain&#8217;t a mindin&#8217; I believe
I&#8217;ll arsk you not ter mention what I done
let slip. I ain&#8217;t ter say sho&#8217; what the fambly
air gonter do &#8217;bout the matter. I done hear
tell they air gonter hab a meetin&#8217; er the whole
bilin&#8217; an&#8217; decide.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do!&#8221; fired Judith. &#8220;They will do nothing.
You can tell them for me that I don&#8217;t give a
hang whether they want to claim kin with me
or not. They did not have the making of me
and I am what I am regardless of them. I
know perfectly well that I am descended from
the same original Bucknors but I&#8217;m glad my
ancestor mislaid part of the name and I
wouldn&#8217;t have the last syllable back for anything
in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yassum!&#8221; gasped Billy.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Billy, I didn&#8217;t mean to be cross with
you,&#8221; laughed Judith, her anger gone as quickly
as it had come, &#8220;but it does rile me for the
family to think themselves so important and to
feel they can have a meeting and make me kin
to them or not as they please.&#8221;</p>
<p>Billy, mounted on Cupid and leading Puck,
rode slowly off. He wagged his great beard
and talked solemnly to himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well now, you ol&#8217; fool nigger, you done
broke yo&#8217; &#8217;lasses pitcher. Whe&#8217;fo&#8217; you so
nimble-come-trimble ter tell little missy &#8217;bout
the fambly confab? &#8217;Cause you done hearn
Marse Big Josh &#8217;sputin&#8217; with Marse Bob
Bucknor at the ball consarnin&#8217; the Bucks an&#8217;
Bucknors ain&#8217;t no reason whe&#8217;fo&#8217; you gotta be
so bigity. Ain&#8217;t yo&#8217; mammy done tell you, time
an&#8217; agin, that ain&#8217;t no flies gonter crawl in a
shet mouf? All you had ter do wa&#8217; ter go an&#8217;
give Miss Judy Buck the trinket an&#8217; kinder
git mo&#8217; &#8217;quainted an&#8217;, little by little, git her ter
look at things yo&#8217; way. You could er let drop
kinder accidental like that she wa&#8217; kinfolks
&#8217;thout bein&#8217; so &#8217;splicit. She done got her back
up now an&#8217; I ain&#8217;t a blamin&#8217; her. She sho&#8217; did
put me in min&#8217; er my Miss Ann when she wa&#8217;
a gal, the way she hilt up her haid an&#8217; jawed
back at the fambly. An&#8217; she would er talked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
the same way if Marse Big Josh an&#8217; Marse
Little Josh an&#8217; Marse Bob Bucknor theyselves
had &#8217;a&#8217; been there an&#8217; all the women folk besides.
That little gal ain&#8217;t feared er nobody. She
done tol&#8217; me ter say she wouldn&#8217;t have back
that extry syllabub on her name fer nothin&#8217;. I
reckon if I&#8217;d tell Marse Jeff that he&#8217;d go up in
the air for fair. But this nigger is done talkin&#8217;&mdash;done
talkin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>He rode on, his brown old face furrowed with
trouble. His bowed legs stuck out comically
and the long tails of his blue coat spread themselves
out on Cupid&#8217;s broad back.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; that putty little cabin in the back, with
po&#8217;ch an&#8217; all, an&#8217; little missy done say it got
furnisher in it too,&#8221; he murmured plaintively.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>A Cavalier O&#8217;erthrown</h3>
</div>
<p>The house party departed and Buck Hill
settled into normalcy. Jeff had tried very hard
to be what Mildred had expected him to be for
the last few days. He had even said tender
nothings to Jean Roland and expressed an eager
desire to see her in Louisville, where she was to
visit before returning to Detroit. So flattering
was his manner that the girl forgave him for
his inattention during her stay at Buck Hill
and was all smiles at the parting.</p>
<p>The guests who did not leave by automobile
took the noon trolley to Louisville. Among the
latter was Tom Harbison. Mildred had rather
hoped he would stay over Sunday at Buck Hill.
He pleaded an engagement, however, but with
melting eyes declared he would soon be back.</p>
<p>Jeff heaved a great sigh of relief when they
were all gone, especially Miss Jean Roland.
What a nuisance black-headed girls were, anyhow!
He began to wonder what Judith was
doing. Was she wearied after the ball? Was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
she on the road in her little blue car selling
toilet articles? Would she feed the motormen
and conductors, in spite of having been up until
morning? Of course she would! Judith was
not the kind of girl to fail in an undertaking
and to let men go hungry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Half past five! She furnishes dinner for
the men on the six-thirty. I wonder what she
is giving them to-day?&#8221; Jeff smiled when he
remembered how Judith had satisfied Nan&#8217;s
impertinent curiosity concerning what was in
her basket. &#8220;I&#8217;ve a great mind to find out.
Foolishness! I&#8217;ll do nothing of the sort.&#8221; The
young man tried to lose himself in the intricate
plot of a detective story but he had to confess
he was not half so much interested in the outcome
of the tale as he was in what Judith was
to carry in her basket.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go help her lift the heavy load on the
trolley,&#8221; he decided, slinging aside the stupid
book and starting across the meadows to the
trolley station. He must traverse the broad
acres of Buck Hill to the dividing line of
Judith&#8217;s mother&#8217;s farm, then through a swampy
creek bottom, up a hill to the grove of old beech
trees, and then down to the trolley track.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t make it! There&#8217;s the whistle blowing
for the next station,&#8221; he said as he reached the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
grove. He stopped and, leaning against the
smooth trunk of a great beech, looked out across
the fields. There was Judith in a blue dress,
standing on the little platform, a cooler of buttermilk
in one hand, swinging it as before as a
signal to the approaching trolley. She wore no
hat and her hair shone like spun gold.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll wait here for her and maybe I can persuade
her to sit down a minute and talk to me.&#8221;
Lazily he settled himself on a mossy bank, leaning
against the friendly trunk.</p>
<p>The trolley car stopped. Eager hands were
ready to receive the heavy cooler and laden
basket. Only one passenger&mdash;a man&mdash;alighted
and then the car sped on. Judith
picked up the basket of empty dishes and milk
can that had been deposited on the platform
and turned to follow the path homeward. Jeff
sprang to his feet, meaning to hasten to her
and relieve her of her burden, when his intention
was changed by seeing the man who had
just alighted from the trolley walk quickly to
her side.</p>
<p>The beech grove was too far off for Jeff to
hear what was said but he could plainly see the
couple, although not discernible to them because
of the dense shade of the beeches. It was a
shock to him to recognize the man as Tom
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
Harbison. What was he doing back again
when he had told Mildred he had an important
engagement? Was his engagement with Judith
Buck? She had not looked as though she expected
anyone as she stood swinging her cooler.
But then one can never tell. Young men don&#8217;t
go gallivanting after girls unless they are encouraged.
On the other hand, what encouragement
had Judith given him, Jeff Bucknor?
None!</p>
<p>However, Tom Harbison certainly had no
right to play fast and loose with his sister, Mildred.
Jeff tried to persuade himself that his
anger against Tom was solely the righteous
anger of a brother.</p>
<p>Judith and her cavalier followed the path that
led directly to the beech grove. Jeff Bucknor
again seated himself on the mossy bank and
watched their approach. He was totally unconscious
of his own invisibility. Again he felt
extreme annoyance with Tom Harbison because
of his protecting manner. Anyone might have
surmised the fields were full of raging bulls,
vicious rams or wild boars, judging from Tom&#8217;s
solicitude for Judith&#8217;s safety. Tenderly he
assisted the active girl up the hill. Just as they
got within earshot of Jeff, who was endeavoring
to calm himself sufficiently to meet the couple
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
with some appearance of equanimity, Judith
paused.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Mr. Harbison, I appreciate very much
your kindness in wishing to help me with this
basket of dishes, which is not at all heavy, but
I think you had much better go directly to your
friends at Buck Hill. That path to the left
will take you through the gap and over the
meadow. I go to the right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, but I am not going to Buck Hill this
evening. I came back to Ryeville only to see
you. I told you, my beauty, that I was going
to. Don&#8217;t you remember?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not your beauty and I do not remember.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I did and I have and you are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you have but I am not. I bid you
good evening, Mr. Harbison. Give me my
basket.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no! Not so fast! You don&#8217;t understand,
my dearest girl. I really have come up
here to see you and a fellow doesn&#8217;t take that
beastly ride twice in one day without some reward.
Come on, like the peach that you
resemble, and sit down here in this grove of trees
with me. I tell you, honey, I&#8217;m loving you good
and right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense! You don&#8217;t know me and besides
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
I have no time to sit down as I have two more
trolley cars to meet with hot suppers for the
motormen. Give me my basket! I must hurry
home. I cannot let my customers go hungry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I am hungry for love,&#8221; cried Tom,
seizing the hand Judith had stretched out for
her basket. In the other hand she carried the
empty milk can. Up to this time the girl had
been half laughing. She was evidently amused
by the gallantries of Tom and had met his advances
with badinage, thinking he was in jest.
However, when he grasped her hand and
attempted to draw her towards him, she grew
angry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me go, Mr. Harbison. You are forgetting
yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not forgetting myself. I am just remembering
myself. Here I have been in the
same neighborhood with you for days and
never once have I had so much as a kiss.
Please! Please!&#8221; He caught the resisting
Judith to him.</p>
<p>Tom was making a fool of himself and no
doubt he would have realized it had he known
that another man was hearing his pleading.
Jeff on the other hand was so conscious of
himself that he had not realized, until Harbison
plunged into the frantic love-making, that the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
couple were not aware of his presence. Under
the circumstances, what should he do? He certainly
could not beat up a man for asking a
beautiful girl to sit down in the shade of a
beech tree with him, especially since he had
meant to do that very thing himself had not
Tom got there ahead of him. Should he make
his presence known? Did Judith need his help?</p>
<p>The scene progressed so rapidly that before
Jeff could make up his mind exactly what he
should do Judith raised her empty milk can and
gave the persistent Tom such a whack on the
side of his head that the cavalier dropped the
basket of china and, losing his balance, fell and
rolled down the hill.</p>
<p>Evidently Judith did not need anyone&#8217;s help.
Tom picked himself up ruefully. Without a
word he retraced the path he had so blithely
taken a moment before and, hearing the outgoing
trolley whistling for the station, he
speeded up and boarded the car for Louisville.</p>
<p>Then Judith proceeded to sit down by her
basket of broken china and burst into tears.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my dear, my dear!&#8221; cried Jeff, no
longer uncertain of what he should do. &#8220;Don&#8217;t!
Please don&#8217;t! I wish I had wrung his neck.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You! Where did you come from?&#8221; gasped
Judith. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t see you. You needn&#8217;t think
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
I am crying because&mdash;because&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because you have been insulted?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I&#8217;m just so miserable because last
night I was so happy, and all day I have been
happy and now I am not.&#8221; She looked like a
little girl who had just found out her doll was
stuffed with sawdust.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at my dishes! As long as they had
to be broken I wish I might have had the pleasure
of hitting that man with them instead of
making a dent in my perfectly good milk
cooler.&#8221; She laughed and began picking up the
pieces of china.</p>
<p>Was this the staid young lawyer who had
determined to see no more of this red-haired
girl&mdash;to nip in the bud any feeling he might
have developed for her? Was this the same
man, running down dale and up hill with a
basket of broken china on his arm, while the
red-haired girl chased on ahead with an empty
milk can, running to make up for lost time and
not be late with the motormen&#8217;s supper? He
must wait and help Judith carry the basket.
She had no time to wrangle with him about
whether he should or should not wait. Supper
was cooked but it must be packed properly and
the finishing touches put to it. Mrs. Buck was
wandering around the kitchen making futile
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
attempts to help. Jeff, who was sitting outside
on a bench under the syringa bushes, could hear
her querulous drawl and Judith&#8217;s quick, good-natured
replies.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind the china, Mumsy. Some of
the pieces can be used as soap dishes and some
maybe we can mend. I&#8217;ll tell you all about how
it happened some day but now I must hurry.
There&#8217;s a young man waiting in the back yard
to help me carry my basket. If you look out
the side window you can see who it is, but don&#8217;t
let him see you peeping.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then there was the mad race back to the
station. There was no time or breath for talk.
They reached the platform several minutes
before the seven o&#8217;clock trolley.</p>
<p>&#8220;Heavens! I came mighty near forgetting
what I came all the way from Buck Hill to find
out,&#8221; declared Jeff.</p>
<p>&#8220;And what was that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I got to wondering what you would have in
your baskets this evening.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ham croquettes, buttered beets, potato
salad and hot muffins. Blackberry dumpling
for dessert!&#8221; Judith smiled, as she chanted the
menu.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>Miss Ann Moves On</h3>
</div>
<p>The Bucknors of Buck Hill were going
abroad. It was all settled and they were to
start as soon as necessary arrangements could
be made. The plan had been born in Mildred&#8217;s
mind and she had influenced her mother, who
in turn had persuaded her husband and now
passage was engaged and it was only a matter
of a few weeks before they would sail.</p>
<p>It had all come about because Jeff had felt
in duty bound to inform his sister that Tom
Harbison had come back to Ryeville with the
intention of calling on another girl, and that
girl Judith Buck.</p>
<p>&#8220;I always said she was a forward minx,&#8221;
stormed Mildred.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right forward with her milk can,&#8221; laughed
Jeff, and then he told of Tom&#8217;s rebuff and of
the blow he had received instead of the kiss he
demanded. &#8220;He&#8217;s not worthy of you, little
sister, and you must not bother your head about
him,&#8221; said Jeff.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span></p>
<p>But Mildred did worry and sulk and feel miserable.
Tom had made more impression on Mildred&#8217;s
heart than Jeff had dreamed possible.
The girl was suffering from blighted affections
as well as mortification&mdash;both of which no
doubt would be dispelled by the European trip.</p>
<p>Jeff was to settle in Louisville and the home
would be closed, with Aunt Em&#8217;ly as caretaker.
But what was to become of Cousin Ann?</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t leave until her visit with us is
completed,&#8221; objected Mr. Bucknor.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, my dear, her visit to us will never be
finished, unless we cut it short,&#8221; sighed Mrs.
Bucknor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let her go visit some of the others,&#8221; suggested
Nan, &#8220;She&#8217;s needing a change by this
time anyhow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We must not be unclannish,&#8221; admonished
Mr. Bucknor. &#8220;Blood is&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, mine is not,&#8221; interrupted Mildred.
&#8220;I&#8217;m just fed up on all of this relationship
business. Old Cousin Ann isn&#8217;t very close kin
to us anyhow, if you stop and think. She
wasn&#8217;t even more than a third cousin to Grandfather
Bucknor, and when it comes down to us
she is so far removed it wouldn&#8217;t count if we
lived anywhere but in Kentucky or maybe Virginia.
I thought you were going to have a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
meeting and come to some conclusion about
Cousin Ann.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So we are! So we are! I have been talking
to Big Josh lately about it. Quite a problem!
Big Josh does nothing but talk and laugh
and we never get anywhere. However, we are
going to have a gathering of the clan to-morrow
in Ryeville and I shall bring up the subject.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t let them persuade you to give
up our trip just to have old Cousin Ann have
a place to visit. We&#8217;ve had more than our
share of her already. If she had a spark of
delicacy she would go now and not wait until
we are all upset with packing and all. I know
you have not told her that we are going abroad,
but you know she snoops around enough to
have heard us talking. I bet she knows what
our plans are as well as we know ourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mildred was right. Miss Ann did know the
plans of her host and hostess. With windows
and doors wide open and a whole family freely
discussing their trip, it would have been difficult
for one who retained the sense of hearing not
to be aware that something was afoot. Miss
Ann had heard and had determined to move on,
but to which relation should she go? The faithful
Billy was called in consultation.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Billy, you have heard?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Miss Ann, I done hearn. I couldn&#8217;t
help a hearin&#8217; with niggers as full of it as
whites.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder why they did not talk openly to
me of their plans.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I reckon they&#8217;s kinder shy, kase me&#8217;n
you&#8217;s a visitin&#8217;. I &#8217;low we&#8217;s gotter move on,
Miss Ann.&#8221; The old man&#8217;s face was drawn
with woe. &#8220;I kinder felt it a bad sign when
Marse Jeff Bucknor up&#8217;n took hisse&#8217;f off to
Lou&#8217;ville, an&#8217; now this talk &#8217;bout the fambly a
goin&#8217; ter furren parts an&#8217; a shuttin&#8217; up Buck
Hill. Th&#8217;ain&#8217;t no good gonter come of it&mdash;but
howsomever we&#8217;s gotter pack up an&#8217; leave.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But where are we going, Billy? Cousin
Big Josh&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lawsamussy, Miss Ann, please don&#8217;t mention
that there domercile! Our ca&#8217;ige ain&#8217;t good
fer that trip. That lane would be the endin&#8217;
er us-all. Don&#8217;t you reckon we&#8217;d better rise
an&#8217; shine to-morrow?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Billy, but where? There&#8217;s Cousin
Little Josh and Cousin Sue and Cousin Tom
and Philip Throckmorton and Cousin David&#8217;s
oldest daughter, whose married name has
escaped me, but she is living in Jefferson
County. Could the horses go so far?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Ann, I ain&#8217;t so sho&#8217; &#8217;bout the ca&#8217;ige,
but I reckon if you don&#8217;t hurry Cupid an&#8217; Puck
none they&#8217;s got a lot er go in them yet. I hear
tell Miss Milly an&#8217; the two young ladies air a&#8217;
contemplatin&#8217; a trip in ter Lou&#8217;ville in the
mawnin&#8217; an&#8217; I done hear Marse Bob say he wa&#8217;
a&#8217; gonter spen&#8217; the day in Ryeville with some
er the kin folks, eatin&#8217; at the hotel. I &#8217;low
they&#8217;ll git a right airly start.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly! Well, so will we, Billy. As soon
as they are gone we will go too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Ann rather liked to make a mystery of
her departure. One of her idiosyncrasies was
that she seldom divulged the name of her next
host to her last one. She would depart as suddenly
as she had arrived, leaving a formal note
of farewell if the head of the house happened to
be away or asleep. She liked to travel early in
the morning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are we going, Billy?&#8221; Miss Ann&#8217;s
voice was tremulous and her eyes were misty.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Miss Ann, s&#8217;pose you jes&#8217; leave that
ter ol&#8217; Billy an&#8217; the hosses. We&#8217;s gonter git
somewhar an&#8217; they ain&#8217;t no use&#8217;n worryin&#8217; whar.
You go down an&#8217; set on the po&#8217;ch an&#8217; I&#8217;ll pack
yo&#8217; things an&#8217; I&#8217;ll do it as good as anybody an&#8217;
we&#8217;ll crope out&#8217;n here in the mawnin&#8217; befo&#8217;
Marse Bob an&#8217; Miss Milly&#8217;s dus&#8217; air settled on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
the pike. I ain&#8217;t a worryin&#8217; &#8217;bout but one thing
an&#8217; that is that a ol&#8217; dominicker hen air took ter
settin&#8217; on the flo&#8217; er our coach an&#8217; I&#8217;m kinder
hatin&#8217; ter &#8217;sturb her when she feels so nice an&#8217;
homelike. I reckon I kin lif her out kinder
sof&#8217; an&#8217; maybe she kin hatch jes the same. She
ain&#8217;t got mo&#8217;n a day er so ter go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Billy, I am sorry to leave the neighborhood
without seeing that lovely girl&mdash;the one who
sent me the gift and to whom the ball was
tendered. She is in reality my kinswoman. I
have been tracing the relationship and find she
is the same kin as my cousins here at Buck Hill&mdash;the
young people I mean. I am sorry I did
not tell her so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yassum! Maybe some day you kin claim
kin with her. I reckon she would be glad an&#8217;
proud ter be cousins ter you, Miss Ann.&#8221;</p>
<p>Billy had never told his mistress of his visit
to Judith. That young person had impressed
him as being not at all proud of being of the
same blood as the Bucknors, or in the least
desirous of claiming the relationship. &#8220;But
she wa&#8217;n&#8217;t speakin&#8217; er my Miss Ann,&#8221; he said
to himself.</p>
<p>Silently and swiftly old Billy packed his mistress&#8217;s
belongings. Every trunk, suitcase and
telescope was in readiness for an early flitting.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
As he had boasted, they were starting almost
before the dust raised by the departing car of
Mr. and Mrs. Bucknor had settled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi, what you so nimble-come-trimble &#8217;bout
this mawnin&#8217;?&#8221; asked Aunt Em&#8217;ly, as she met
Billy laden with baggage, sneaking out the back
way, planning to load his coach before hitching
up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Ann an&#8217; me is done got a invite ter a
house pawty an&#8217; we air gonter hit the pike in
the cool er the mawnin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wha&#8217; you goin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Heaben when we die,&#8221; was all Billy would
divulge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Milly an&#8217; Marse Bob ain&#8217;t said nothin&#8217;
&#8217;bout Miss Ann leavin&#8217;. Fac&#8217; is Miss Milly lef&#8217;
word fer me ter dish up a good dinner fer Miss
Ann whilst they wa&#8217; away an&#8217; serve it on a tray
bein&#8217; as she wa&#8217; all alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I &#8217;low we&#8217;ll be settin&#8217; down in the
dinin&#8217;-room at the house pawty come dinner
time,&#8221; declared the old man, veiled insolence in
his tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;What I gonter tell Marse Bob an&#8217; Miss
Milly when they axes wha&#8217; Miss Ann done took
herself?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t consarned with what you tells &#8217;em.
My Miss Ann air done writ a letter ter Miss
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
Milly an&#8217; if you ain&#8217;t got a lie handy you kin
jes&#8217; han&#8217; her the billy dux.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I allus been holdin&#8217; ter it an&#8217; I&#8217;ll give it ter
you extry clarified, you&#8217;s a mean nigger man&mdash;mean
an&#8217; low lifed. I axes you, politeful like,
wha&#8217; you an&#8217; Miss Ann a goin&#8217; an&#8217; all you kin
give me is sass.&#8221; Aunt Em&#8217;ly was full of curiosity
and was greatly irritated not to have her
curiosity satisfied. But Billy was adamant and
Miss Ann more dignified than usual, as she
doled out her small tips&mdash;all the poor old lady
could afford, but presented to the servants
whenever she departed with the air of royalty.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, skip-ter-ma-loo, she&#8217;s gone agin!&#8221;
laughed Aunt Em&#8217;ly, as she stood with Kizzie
and watched the old coach rolling down the avenue.
&#8220;I reckon Marse Bob&#8217;s gonter be right
riled that I can&#8217;t tell him wha&#8217; she goin&#8217; but you
couldn&#8217;t git nothin&#8217; outer that ol&#8217; Billy with an
ice pick. I laid off ter ax Miss Ann herself
but when she come a sailin&#8217; down the steps like
she done swallowed the poker an&#8217; helt out this
here dime ter me like it wa&#8217; a dollar somehow
she looked kinder awesome an&#8217; I couldn&#8217;t say
nothin&#8217; but &#8216;Thanky!&#8217; Kizzie, did you notice
which-away the coach took when they reached
the pike?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it went up the road to&#8217;ds Marse Big
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
Josh&#8217;s,&#8221; said Kizzie, &#8220;but the dus&#8217; air pow&#8217;ful
thick right now, owin&#8217; ter ortermobiles goin&#8217;
both ways, so I ain&#8217;t quite sho&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wa&#8217; pretty night certain ol&#8217; Billy p&#8217;inted
his hosses&#8217; heads to&#8217;ds Ryeville, but I ain&#8217;t sho&#8217;.
It air sech a misty, moisty mornin&#8217; an&#8217; what
with the dus&#8217; it air hard ter punctuate. I reckon
you&#8217;s right, Kizzie, an&#8217; they&#8217;s hit the pike fer
Marse Big Josh&#8217;s. Anyhow we&#8217;ll say that when
Marse Bob axes us. If you tells one tale an&#8217;
I tells anudder Marse Bob&#8217;ll be mad as a wet
hen.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old coach, creaking ominously, lumbered
and rolled down the avenue. The bees, with
their front door blocked by the corn cob,
hummed furiously. Miss Ann, ensconced behind
the barricade of luggage, gazed out on the
rolling meadows of Buck Hill and thought bitterly
of the old days when devoted cavaliers
accompanied her coach, eager to escort her on
her journey and vying with one another for a
smile from the careless girl within.</p>
<p>She tried to remember the intervening years
but could not. She was a beautiful young girl,
sought after, welcomed everywhere. Then she
was an old woman, unloved, unwelcome, nobody
wanting her, nobody loving her. She did not
know where Billy was driving her. She did not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
care. The old man had taken matters into his
own hands and no doubt he would leave the
decision to Cupid and Puck. She put her head
against the upholstered back of the seat and
dozed. The morning air came sweet and fresh
across the blue-grass meadows. She had a
dream, vague and uncertain, but in some unexpected
and shadowy way she was happy. She
awoke and dozed again. Again a sweet dream
of peace and contentment.</p>
<p>The horses came to a standstill. Miss Ann
awoke with a start. She did not know whether
she had slept moments or hours. Billy had
opened the door and was saying: &#8220;Miss Ann,
we done arriv!&#8221; and then he began to unpack
his beloved mistress.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>A Heart-warming Welcome</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Mumsy, here comes Cousin Ann!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There you are at it again, Judith. I say
shame on you for calling people cousin who
don&#8217;t even know they are related.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyhow, here comes Cousin Ann!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Comes where? Along the pike? I don&#8217;t
see that that is anything to get excited over.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it is not along the pike. She is coming
here&mdash;here in our home. Old Billy has stopped
the horses and is down off his box and has
opened the door and is unpacking the luggage.
After a little while he will come to Cousin Ann.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know what that means, Mumsy?
It means that we are to be taken into the bosom
of the family, as it were. Cousin Ann only
visits relations. I reckon I&#8217;m a snob but I can&#8217;t
help being glad that I am to belong. I won&#8217;t
let anybody but you know that, Mumsy, but
I&#8217;m going to be just as nice and kind to poor
Cousin Ann as can be. You will too, won&#8217;t you,
dear Mumsy?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I guess I know how to treat company,&#8221;
bridled Mrs. Buck.</p>
<p>Miss Ann sat, dazed and wondering, while
Billy pulled out the luggage and piled it up by
the white picket fence. She did not know where
the old coachman had brought her. She wondered
vaguely if it could be the home of Cousin
David&#8217;s oldest daughter whose married name
had escaped her. Could she have slept a whole
day?</p>
<p>Suddenly a red-haired girl in a blue dress
came running down the walk and before Billy
could get his mistress unpacked this girl had
sprung into the coach and putting her arms
around Miss Ann&#8217;s neck kissed her first on one
cheek and then on the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother and I are real glad to see you and
we hope you and Uncle Billy will stay with us
just as long as you are comfortable and happy,&#8221;
said Judith. &#8220;Howdy, Uncle Billy!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Howdy, missy!&#8221; Great tears were coursing
down the old brown face.</p>
<p>&#8220;The guest chamber is all ready, except for
being sheeted and that won&#8217;t take me a minute.
Just bring the things right in, Uncle Billy.
Here, I&#8217;ll help and then Miss Ann can get out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cousin Ann, child! I am your Cousin Ann
Peyton.&#8221; Miss Ann spoke from the depths of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
the coach. And then Mrs. Buck, having hastily
tied on a clean apron, came down the walk and
was introduced to the visitor, greeting her with
shy hospitality.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m pleased to meet you. Judith and I&#8217;ll
be right glad of your company.&#8221;</p>
<p>How long had it been since anybody had said
that to Miss Ann? The old lady flushed with
pleasure.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are my cousin-in-law, but I don&#8217;t know
your name.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Prudence&mdash;Prudence Knight was my
maiden name.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, then, Cousin Prudence! It is very kind
of you and your daughter to greet me so cordially.
I hope Billy and I will not be much
trouble during our short stay with you. Are
you certain it is convenient to have us?&#8221;</p>
<p>Now be it noted that in all of the long years
of visiting Miss Ann Peyton had never before
asked whether or not her coming was convenient.
Hitherto she had simply come and
stayed until it suited her to move on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed it is convenient,&#8221; cried Judith.
&#8220;Mother and I are here all alone and we have
loads of room.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Mr. and Mrs. Ezra Knight broke up
housekeeping in New England they moved
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
every stick of furniture they possessed to their
new home. This furniture had been in the
family for generations. There were old highboys
of polished mahogany and chaste design,
four-poster beds and gate-legged tables, a
Sheraton sideboard and Chippendale chairs, a
claw-footed secretary with leaded glass doors
and secret drawers. There were hooked rugs
and patchwork quilts of intricate and wonderful
design, hand woven bedspreads of a blue seldom
seen and Chinese cabinets and strange
grotesque brasses, no doubt brought to New
England by the Norse sailor man who had left
his mark on the family according to Mrs. Buck.</p>
<p>Miss Ann Peyton felt singularly at home
from the moment she entered the front door.
The guest chamber, where old Dick Buck had
made it convenient to spend the last years of
his life, was so pleasant one hardly blamed the
old man for establishing himself there. A low-pitched
room it was, with windows looking out
over the meadow and furnished with mahogany
so rare and beautiful it might have graced a
museum.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Cousin Ann, please make yourself
absolutely at home. If you want to unpack
immediately there is a dandy closet here, and
here is a wardrobe and here is a highboy and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
here a bureau. Uncle Billy can take your
trunks to the attic when you empty them. I
wish I could help you, but Mumsy and I are
up to our necks canning peaches and we can&#8217;t
stop a minute. If you want to come help peel
we&#8217;d be delighted. We are on the side porch
and it is lovely and cool out there,&#8221; and Judith
was gone.</p>
<p>Help peel peaches! Why not? Miss Ann
smiled. Nobody ever asked her to help. It was
a new experience for her. She decided not to
unpack immediately, but donned an apron and
hastened to the side porch.</p>
<p>It was pleasant there. Mrs. Buck was peeling
laboriously, anxious not to waste a particle
of fruit. She stopped long enough to get a
paring knife and bowl for the visitor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Judith has gone to show your servant where
to put the carriage and horses and then to open
up the house in the back for him. It was the
old house the Bucks had before my father
bought this place&mdash;a good enough house with
furniture in it. Judith gives it a big cleaning
now and then and I reckon the old man can
move right in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Old Billy was in the seventh heaven of delight.
A stable for Cupid and Puck, with
plenty of good pasture land, a carriage house
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
for the coach, shared with Judith&#8217;s little blue
car, but best of all, a house for himself!</p>
<p>&#8220;A house with winders an&#8217; a chimbly an&#8217; a
po&#8217;ch wha&#8217; I kin sot cans er jewraniums an&#8217; a
box er portulac! I been a dreamin&#8217; &#8217;bout sech
a house all my life, Miss Judy. Sometimes
when I is fo&#8217;ced ter sleep in the ca&#8217;ige, when
Miss Ann an&#8217; me air a visitin&#8217; wha&#8217; things air
kinder crowded like, I digs me up a little flower
an&#8217; plants it in a ol&#8217; can an&#8217; kinder makes out
my coachman&#8217;s box air a po&#8217;ch. Miss Judy, it
air a sad thing ter git ter be ol&#8217; an&#8217; wo&#8217; out
&#8217;thout ever gittin&#8217; what you wanted when you
wa&#8217; young an&#8217; spry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Uncle Billy, I know how you feel, but
now you have a little house and you can live in
it as long as it suits you and grow all the flowers
you&#8217;ve a mind to. Nobody has lived in it
for years and years but I used to play down
here when I was a little girl and had time to
play. Every now and then I give it a good
cleaning, though, and you won&#8217;t have to do
much to start with.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a rough, two-roomed cabin, with
shabby furniture, but it seemed like a palace to
the old darkey.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon I&#8217;ll put me up a red curtain,&#8221; he
sighed. &#8220;I been always a wantin&#8217; a red
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
curtain, an&#8217; bless Bob, if they ain&#8217;t already a row
of skillets an&#8217; cookin&#8217; pots by the chimbly. I
am moughty partial ter a big open fiah place
wha&#8217; you kin make yo&#8217; se&#8217;f a ol&#8217; time ash cake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you cook, Uncle Billy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sho&#8217; I kin cook, but I ain&#8217;t git much chanct
ter cook, what with livin&#8217; roun&#8217; so much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you can help me sometimes when I
get pushed for time,&#8221; and Judith told the old
man of the task she had undertaken of feeding
the motormen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sholy! Sholy!&#8221; he agreed and then the
thought came to him as it had to Miss Ann&mdash;When
before had he been asked to help?</p>
<p>Judith found the two ladies busily engaged
in paring peaches. She was amused to discover
that Miss Ann was quicker than her mother and
more expert. The old lady&#8217;s fingers were nimble
and dainty and she handled her knife with
remarkable skill.</p>
<p>&#8220;My goodness! You go so fast I can begin
to can,&#8221; cried Judith. Miss Ann&#8217;s face beamed
with happiness as she watched her young cousin
weighing sugar and fruit and then lighting the
kerosene stove which stood behind a screen in
the corner of the porch.</p>
<p>Judith kept up a lively chatter as she sterilized
glass jars and dipped out the cooked fruit.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
Miss Ann worked faster and faster and even
Mrs. Buck hurried in spite of herself. Uncle
Billy&#8217;s amazement was ludicrous when he came
upon his mistress making one of this busy family
group. But in an instant the old man was
helping, too.</p>
<p>The morning was gone but the peaches were
all canned, the table filled with amber-colored
jars. Billy must carry them to the storeroom
and place them on the shelves. He ran back
and forth looking like a little brown gnome and
actually skipping with happiness. Miss Ann
smiled contentedly while Mrs. Buck gathered
up the peach skins and stones which she had
saved with a view to making marmalade,
although Judith assured her that the peach crop
was so big that year there would be no use in
such close economy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, we&#8217;ll have luncheon and then everybody
must take a nap,&#8221; commanded Judith and
everybody was very glad to, after the strenuous
morning&#8217;s work, but first Billy slipped out to
the carriage house and pulled the corn cob out
of the bumble bees&#8217; hole.</p>
<p>&#8220;There now, you po&#8217; critters! I reckon you
kin call this home too an&#8217; jes&#8217; buzz aroun&#8217; all
you&#8217;se a min&#8217; ter,&#8221; the old man whispered
happily.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>The Clan In Conclave</h3>
</div>
<p>Mr. Bob Bucknor was troubled. He had
always prided himself on keeping an open house
for his relations and to him Cousin Ann was a
kind of symbol of consanguinity. He paid very
little attention to her as a rule, except to be
scrupulously polite. He had been trained in
politeness to Cousin Ann from his earliest childhood
and had endeavored to bring his own children
up with the same strict regard to hospitality
and courtesy to his aged relative. His son
had profited by his teaching and was ever kindly
to the old lady, but his daughters had rebelled,
and it could not be denied were even openly
rude to the chronic visitor. Now this project of
European travel was afoot and the problem of
what to do with Cousin Ann must be settled.
The masculine representatives of the family
were meeting in Ryeville and the matter was
soon under discussion.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the women,&#8221; declared Big Josh. &#8220;They
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
are kicking like steers and they say they won&#8217;t
stand for her any longer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My wife says she has got a nice old cousin
who would like to come and stay with us, and
that she does all the darning wherever she stays
and looks after the children besides. Nobody
ever heard of Cousin Ann turning a hand to
help anybody,&#8221; said Little Josh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I fancy you have heard the news that
I am taking my wife and daughters abroad this
month and I cannot keep the poor old lady any
longer,&#8221; sighed Bob Bucknor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, Bob, we think you&#8217;ve had too much
of her already,&#8221; said Sister Sue&#8217;s husband, Timothy
Graves, &#8220;but Sue says she can&#8217;t visit with
us any more. The children are big enough now
to demand separate rooms and our house is not
very large&mdash;not as large as it used to be somehow.
In old days people didn&#8217;t mind doubling
up, but nobody wants to double up with Cousin
Ann and her horses are a nuisance and that old
Billy irritates the servants and&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My mother says an old ladies&#8217; home is the
only thing for her,&#8221; said David Throckmorton.</p>
<p>&#8220;So do all the women. But who&#8217;s going to
bell the cat?&#8221; asked Big Josh.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon we&#8217;ll have to go in a body and
speak in chorus,&#8221; suggested Little Josh. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
was thus decided, after much argument. All
the cousins were willing to contribute something
towards the support of the old lady, but nobody
was willing or able to take her in his home.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, we must provide for old Billy,
too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, after dinner all of you ride out to
Buck Hill and there wait on the poor old thing
and together we can break the news to her.
It&#8217;s going to make me feel awfully bad,&#8221; declared
Mr. Bob Bucknor.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon we&#8217;ll all feel bad, but none of us
must weaken,&#8221; blustered Big Josh. &#8220;And
while we are discussing family matters, how
about this talk about that pretty Miss Judith
Buck being a cousin?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The women folk have settled that. At
least mine have; and since we are the closest
neighbors there at Buck Hill&mdash;&#8221; began Bob
Bucknor.</p>
<p>&#8220;You may be the closest neighbors, but you
are not the closest kin. I&#8217;m for taking her into
the clan. By golly, we haven&#8217;t got too many
pretty women in our family to be turning any
down. I tell you, I&#8217;m going to call on her.
Owe her a party call anyhow.&#8221; Thus rumbled
Big Josh.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Better not,&#8221; warned Mr. Bob Bucknor and
then, since the clan were having dinner at the
hotel where &#8220;you could&#8221; and a feeling of good
cheer had begun to permeate the diners, Mr.
Bucknor proceeded to tell the story, of course
in the strictest confidence, about Tom Harbison
and the milk can, all of which went to convince
others beside Big Josh that Judith might prove
a valuable acquisition to the family.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon she&#8217;s coped with worse than our
women,&#8221; said Little Josh. &#8220;With poverty staring
her in the face and old Dick Buck for a
grandfather, she&#8217;s kept her head up and made
a living and got a tidy bank account, so I hear.
All by herself, too! I think I&#8217;ll call when
you do, Big Josh, but I&#8217;ll fight shy of the milk
cans.&#8221;</p>
<p>So it was voted that Judith was to be received
into the family, Mr. Bob Bucknor making
a mental reservation that he would not
divulge the news to his wife and daughters
until they were well out of Kentucky. He had
strong hopes that European travel might soften
the hearts of his daughters towards their pretty,
red-haired cousin and neighbor.</p>
<p>&#8220;While we&#8217;ve got a little Dutch courage
left, let&#8217;s go on out to Buck Hill and tackle
Cousin Ann,&#8221; said Big Josh. &#8220;Now
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
remember, all at once and nobody backing out and
coughing. Everybody speak up strong and all
together.&#8221;</p>
<p>A handsome family of men they were, taken
all in all&mdash;handsome and prosperous, good citizens,
honorable, upright, courageous&mdash;but this
thing of deliberately getting together to inform
a poor old woman that no longer would their
several homes be ready to receive her made them
seem to themselves anything but admirable.</p>
<p>&#8220;Darn the women folks, I say!&#8221; rumbled
Big Josh. &#8220;If they weren&#8217;t so selfish and bent
on their own pleasure we would not have to be
doing this miserable thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps if we had helped them a little with
Cousin Ann they wouldn&#8217;t be kicking so,&#8221;
humbly suggested Little Josh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Help them! Help them! How in Pete&#8217;s
name could we help them any more? I am sure
I have allowed Cousin Ann to give me a lamp
mat every Christmas since I was born and my
attic is full of her hoop skirts.&#8221; A smile went
the rounds and Big Josh subsided.</p>
<p>Buck Hill never looked more hospitable or
attractive, as the cousins speeded up the driveway&mdash;two
cars full of Kentucky blue blood.
The gently rolling meadows dotted with grazing
cattle, the great friendly beech trees on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
shaven lawn, the monthly roses in the garden,
the ever-blooming honeysuckle clambering over
the summer-house seemed to cry out, &#8220;Welcome
to all!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee! Poor Cousin Ann!&#8221; muttered one.
&#8220;No wonder she likes to stay here.&#8221;</p>
<p>An unwonted silence fell on the group, as
they tiptoed up the front walk. They could
not have said why they walked so quietly, but
had they been called on to serve as pall bearers
to their aged relative they would not have entered
into the duty with any greater solemnity.</p>
<p>Aunt Em&#8217;ly appeared at the front door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lawsamussy, Marse Bob, you done give
me a turn,&#8221; she gasped, bobbing a courtesy to
the assembled gentlemen. &#8220;Is you done et?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, Aunt Em&#8217;ly, we have had dinner,
but we should like to&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yassir! I&#8217;ll git the ice cracked in no time
an&#8217; sen&#8217; Kizzie fer some mint.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet, Aunt Em&#8217;ly,&#8221; faltered her master
miserably. &#8220;A little later, perhaps, but
now&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know! You done had a po&#8217; dinner an&#8217;
come home fer some &#8217;spectable victuals. It
ain&#8217;t gonter take me long.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all, Aunt Em&#8217;ly, we had an excellent
dinner, but now&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Call Miss Ann Peyton,&#8221; blustered Big
Josh. &#8220;Tell her her cousins all want to see
her,&#8221; and then he swelled his chest with pride.
He for one wasn&#8217;t going to back out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Ann done gone,&#8221; grinned Aunt Em&#8217;ly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gone where?&#8221; they asked in chorus.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gawd knows! She an&#8217; ol&#8217; Billy an&#8217; the
hosses done took theyselves off this mawnin&#8217; jes&#8217;
&#8217;bout five minutes after my white folks lef.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t she say where she was going?&#8221; asked
Mr. Bucknor.</p>
<p>&#8220;She never said &#8216;peep turkey!&#8217; ter man or
beast. She lef&#8217; a dime fer me an&#8217; one fer Kizzie
an&#8217; she went a sailin&#8217; out, an&#8217; although I done
my bes&#8217; ter git that ol&#8217; Billy ter talk he ain&#8217;t
done give me no satisfaction, but jes&#8217; a little
back talk, an&#8217; then he fotch hisself off, walkin&#8217;
low an&#8217; settin&#8217; high an&#8217; I ain&#8217;t seed hide or har
of them since. Miss Ann done lef&#8217; a note fer
you an&#8217; Miss Milly, though.&#8221;</p>
<p>The note proved to be nothing more than
Miss Ann&#8217;s usual formal farewell and did not
mention her proposed destination.</p>
<p>&#8220;By the great jumping jingo, I hope she
didn&#8217;t try my lane with her old carriage!&#8221; exclaimed
Big Josh. &#8220;That lane, with the women
in my family at the end of it, would be the
undoing of poor old Cousin Ann. May I use
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
your phone, Bob? I think I&#8217;ll find out if she&#8217;s
there before I go home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Every man rang up his home and every man
breathed a sigh of relief when he found that
Miss Ann had not arrived. Wild and varied
were their surmises concerning where she had
gone.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the most disgraceful thing that ever
happened in the family,&#8221; declared Timothy
Graves. &#8220;Of course I know I am only law-kin,
but still I feel the disgrace.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t be so proud of yourself, Tim,
because you were some kin already before you
married Sister Sue,&#8221; chided Brother Tom. &#8220;I
can&#8217;t see that you are not in on it too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I said.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but you said it because you really felt
it in your favor that you were law-kin,&#8221; put in
Little Josh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, come,&#8221; pleaded Mr. Bob Bucknor,
&#8220;rowing with each other isn&#8217;t finding out where
Cousin Ann has gone. Kizzie! Aunt Em&#8217;ly!&#8221;
he shouted, &#8220;get that cracked ice and mint
now. Come on, you fellows, and let&#8217;s see if
we can find any inspiration in the bottom of a
frosted goblet.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>A Great Transformation</h3>
</div>
<p>It was unbelievable that a lumbering coach,
with two fat horses, an old lady in a hoop skirt
and a bow-legged coachman, could have disappeared
from the face of the earth. Nevertheless,
this seemed the case. Nobody knew where
Cousin Ann had gone. Telephones were ringing
into the night in vain attempts to trace the
old lady. It had never made much difference
to anyone before where Miss Ann had gone.
For many years she had been leaving one relation&#8217;s
home and arriving at another&#8217;s, and the
comings and goings of Cousin Ann had created
but a small ripple in family affairs. She had
never deigned to say where next she intended to
visit, so why now should the cousins be so disturbed
over her whereabouts?</p>
<p>&#8220;I am so afraid something has happened to
her,&#8221; said Mr. Bob Bucknor. &#8220;I&#8217;ll never forgive
myself if Cousin Ann is in trouble, when
I have literally driven her from my house.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, my dear, you have not driven her from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
your home,&#8221; comforted his wife. &#8220;You had
only intended to inform her that we were planning
a trip abroad and she would have to visit
somewhere else until arrangements could be
made for her to be established in an old ladies&#8217;
home. There was nothing cruel in that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, but Cousin Ann is so proud and Buck
Hill has always been a refuge for her.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other cousins were likewise agitated.
For Cousin Ann to have disappeared just as
they were contemplating wounding her made
them think that they had already wounded her.
&#8220;Poor old lady!&#8221; was all they could say, and
all of them said it until their women-folk were
exceedingly bored with the remark.</p>
<p>Mr. Bob Bucknor determined to send for
Jeff, if something definite was not heard of
the missing cousin within the next twenty-four
hours. He vaguely felt that it might be time
for the law to step in and help in the search.</p>
<p>In the meantime Miss Ann was very happy
in the house built by Ezra Knight; and Uncle
Billy was even happier in the cabin built by
the Bucks of old. The Peyton coach stood
peacefully in the carriage house, with the bees
buzzing sleepily, free to come and go in their
subway nest somewhere under the back seat.
Cupid and Puck wandered in the blue-grass
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
meadow, content as though they had been put
to graze in the Elysian fields.</p>
<p>The first night under the roof of her newly
recognized cousins was a novel one for Miss
Ann. She had gone to bed not in the least
bored, but very tired&mdash;tired from actual labor.
In the first place, she had helped wipe all the
many dishes accumulated from the motormen&#8217;s
dinners and then put them away. That task
completed, she had become interested in Judith&#8217;s
work of mounting photographs&mdash;an order
lately received and one that must be rushed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Want to help?&#8221; Judith had asked, and
soon deft old fingers were vying with young
ones.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Cousin Ann, you have regular fairy
fingers,&#8221; said Judith, and the old lady had
blushed with delight. They worked until the
task was completed, while Mrs. Buck nodded
over &#8220;Holy Living and Dying.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the morning, when Judith made her early
way to the kitchen, she found a fire burning
briskly in the stove, the kettle ready to boil and
the wood box filled. Uncle Billy, smiling happily,
was seated in the doorway. Judith thanked
him heartily and he assured her he liked to help
white ladies, but didn&#8217;t hold much to helping
his own race.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span></p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;s ongrateful an&#8217; proudified an&#8217; the
mo&#8217; you holps &#8217;em the mo&#8217; they shifts. Me&#8217;n
Miss Ann has been visitin so long we ain&#8217;t
entered much inter housekeepin&#8217;, but somehow
we seem so sot an&#8217; statiumnary now that it
comes nachul ter both er us ter len&#8217; a han&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s nice,&#8221; laughed Judith. &#8220;I do hope
you and Cousin Ann and Cupid and Puck will
all feel at home. I wish you would keep your
eye open for a nice, respectable woman who
could help me, now that I have so many dinners
to serve to the trolley men.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I sho&#8217; will&mdash;an&#8217;, Miss Judy, I&#8217;m wonderin&#8217;
if you ain&#8217;t got a little bitser blue cloth what I
mought patch my pants with. If my coattails
wa&#8217;n&#8217;t so long I wouldn&#8217;t be fitten ter go
&#8217;mongst folks.&#8221;</p>
<p>After some discussion with her mother, in
which the girl tried to make Mrs. Buck see the
difference between saving and hoarding, Judith
finally produced for old Billy many leftovers
of maternal and paternal grandfathers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mumsy, you are a trump. Now, you see
you saved these things so someone deserving
could use them, but if they had stayed in the
attic until the moths had eaten them up while
old Billy went ragged then that would have been
wasteful hoarding.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not minding so much about your
Grandfather Buck&#8217;s things, but somehow it
seems a desecration for that old darkey to be
wearing your Grandfather Knight&#8217;s trousers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what makes me say you are a trump,
Mumsy. I know you look upon those broadcloth
pants as a kind of sacred trust, and I
just love you to death for giving in about
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And my father was tall and straight of
limb, too,&#8221; wailed Mrs. Buck. &#8220;It seems
worse because old Billy&#8217;s legs are so short and
crooked.&#8221;</p>
<p>Crooked they may have been, but short they
were not. By the time the broadcloth trousers
traveled the circuitous route of the old man&#8217;s
legs everything came out even.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fit me like they was made fer me,&#8221; he
exclaimed, showing himself to Judith.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps they were,&#8221; mused Judith. &#8220;And
now the coat!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a rusty coat, long of tail and known
at the time of its pristine glory as a &#8220;Prince
Albert.&#8221; Ezra Knight had kept it for funerals
and other ceremonious occasions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there ary hat?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was&mdash;a high silk hat with a broad
brim. Mrs. Buck rather thought it was one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
that had belonged to her grandfather and not
her father. At any rate, it rested comfortably
on Billy&#8217;s cotton white wool.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Uncle Billy, trim your beard and
nobody will know you,&#8221; suggested Judith. So
trim his beard he did, much to the improvement
of his appearance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reform number one!&#8221; said Judith to herself.</p>
<p>Miss Ann slept the sleep of industry that
first night at the Bucks&#8217;, and the sun was high
when she opened her tired old eyes. She lay
still for a moment, wondering where she was.
This room was different from any of the other
guest chambers she had occupied. There was
a kind of austerity in the quaint old furniture
that was lacking in the bedrooms where modern
taste held sway. Nothing had been taken from
or added to the Bucks&#8217; guest chamber since
Grandmother Knight had reverently placed
there her best highboy and her finest mahogany
bed and candle stand. On the mantel was the
model of a ship that tradition said the Norse
sailor had carved, and on the walls steel engravings
of Milton and Newton&mdash;Milton looking
up at the stars seeking the proper rhymes,
and Newton with eyes cast down searching out
the power of gravity from the ground.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span></p>
<p>Miss Ann looked on her surroundings and
smiled peacefully. She thought over the happenings
of yesterday and again she realized that
it was a pleasant thing to be wanted. There
was a knock at the door. Billy, no doubt with
hot water and maybe an early cup of coffee.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was Judith bearing a tray of breakfast.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a bit of use in your getting up early,
Cousin Ann, but every reason for you to have
breakfast while it is fresh and hot, so I just
brought it in to you. I often make my mother
stay in bed for breakfast if she is not feeling
very strong. There is nothing like starting the
day with something in your tummy. It is a
lovely day with a touch of autumn in the air.
I do hope you slept.&#8221;</p>
<p>Judith chattered on, ignoring the fact that
Miss Ann was evidently embarrassed that she
had been caught minus her wig. The girl
opened wide the shutters, letting the sunlight
stream into the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Cousin Ann, what wonderful hair you
have! Why it is like the driven snow and as
soft as silk! Please, please let me arrange it
for you sometimes. I don&#8217;t know whether you
ought to wear it piled on your head in coils
and puffs, like a French beauty of way back
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
yonder, or parted in the middle and waved on
each side and drawn back into a loose knot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, child, you can&#8217;t think gray hair pretty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, it is the loveliest thing in the world.
If I had hair like yours I&#8217;d never cover it up.
You will let me try to dress it won&#8217;t you? I
just love to touch it,&#8221; and Judith fondled one
of the silvered plats.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; faltered the old lady. How long had
it been since anyone but old Billy had complimented
her? And when had anyone said her
hair might be soft to the touch? Wigs do not
last forever and Miss Ann had begun to realize
that before many weeks a new one would be
imperative. A new wig meant even greater
scrimping than usual for Billy and his mistress.
Funds must be very carefully handled when
such an outlay became necessary. It was next
in importance to a new horse, and greater than
renewing a wheel on the coach. She had never
dreamed that she might get along without a wig.
She had begun wearing a wig many years ago,
when her hair turned gray in spots. She had
always considered dyed hair rather vulgar and
so had resorted to a wig and, true to her character
for keeping up a custom, she had never discarded
the wig, although her hair had long
since turned snow-white from root to end.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Reform number two,&#8221; Judith said to herself
as she viewed her handiwork on Cousin
Ann&#8217;s hair. It was decided to part it in the
middle and wave it on the sides and sweetly
the old lady&#8217;s face was framed in the soft,
silver locks.</p>
<p>&#8220;You look different from yourself, but
lovely,&#8221; cried Judith. &#8220;You make me think of
a young person trying to look old.&#8221;</p>
<p>She might have added: &#8220;Instead of an old
person trying to look young,&#8221; but she did not.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>The Lost Is Found</h3>
</div>
<p>Two days passed and still the Bucknor clan
was in ignorance of the whereabouts of Cousin
Ann. It had so happened that Judith had been
busy at home and had not gone into Ryeville
for several days and nobody had called at her
home, although since the famous debut party
the Bucks had many more visitors than
formerly.</p>
<p>Cousin Ann could not have concealed herself
from the world more effectually had she tried.
Concealment was far from her thoughts, however.
She had no idea that a hue and cry would
be raised for her. The Fates, in the shapes of
Billy, Cupid and Puck, had taken her destiny
in hand and landed her with this golden girl,
who wanted her and loved her and petted her
and made her feel at home. Here she would
stay. How long? She would not let herself
dwell on that subject.</p>
<p>What the rest of the family would think of
her claiming kin with the hitherto impossible
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
Bucks made little difference to the old lady.
She determined never to divulge that old Billy
had engineered the visit, but intended, when the
question came up with her kinsmen, to let it be
understood that she, Ann Peyton, had ruled
that Judith Buck belonged to the family and
had as good a right to the name of Bucknor as
any person bearing the name.</p>
<p>The old men of Ryeville were seated in tilted
chairs on the hotel porch. The little touch
of autumn in the air made it rather pleasant
when the sun sought out their feet resting on
the railing.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this I hear about the disappearance
of Miss Ann Peyton?&#8221; asked Major Fitch.
&#8220;Someone told me that she has not been heard
of now for several days and Bob Bucknor is
just about having a fit over it. He and Big
Josh are scouring the country for her, after
having burnt up all the telephone wires in the
county trying to locate her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s true,&#8221; chuckled Colonel Crutcher. &#8220;My
granddaughter says Mildred Bucknor is raising
a rumpus because her father is saying he can&#8217;t
go abroad until Cousin Ann is found. First, he
can&#8217;t go because the old lady is visiting him
and now he can&#8217;t go because she isn&#8217;t visiting
him.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, a big, old ramshackledy rockaway
like Miss Ann&#8217;s, with a pair of horses fat
enough to eat and the bow-leggedest coachman
in Kentucky, to say nothing of Miss Ann herself
with her puffy red wig and hoop skirts as
wide as a barn door, couldn&#8217;t disappear in a
rat hole. They must be somewhere and they
must have gone along the road to get where they
were going. Certainly they haven&#8217;t passed this
way or we&#8217;d have seen them,&#8221; said Judge Middleton.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hear tell Bob Bucknor has sent for Jeff
to come and advise him,&#8221; drawled Pete Barnes.
&#8220;And I also hear tell that the Bucknor men
were gettin&#8217; ready to let poor ol&#8217; Miss Ann
know that she was due to settle herself in an
ol&#8217; ladies&#8217; home. They were cookin&#8217; it up that
day they all had dinner here last week.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and what&#8217;s more, I hear our Judy gal
knocked that Tom Harbison down the hill with
a milk bucket,&#8221; laughed Pete. &#8220;I got it
straight from Big Josh himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the old men gossiped, basking in the
autumn sunshine. They still quarreled over the
outcome of the war between the states, but now
they had a fresh topic of never-ending interest
to discuss and that was their own debut party.
Congratulations were ever in order on their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
extreme cleverness in giving the ball.</p>
<p>Pete Barnes was ever declaring, &#8220;It was my
idee, though, my idee! And didn&#8217;t we launch
our little girl, though? I hear tell she is going
to be asked to join the girls&#8217; club. That&#8217;s a
secret. I believe the girls are going to wait
until Mildred and Nan Bucknor are on the
rolling deep. As for the young men&mdash;they are
worse than bears about a bee tree. Judy won&#8217;t
have much to do with them though. But you
needn&#8217;t tell me she doesn&#8217;t like it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure she does. She&#8217;s too healthy-minded not
to like beaux. There she comes now! I can
see her car way up the street&mdash;just a blue
speck,&#8221; cried Judge Middleton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure enough! There she is! She&#8217;s got her
mother in with her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not Mrs. Buck. Mrs. Buck always
sits in Judy&#8217;s car as though she were scared to
death&mdash;and she hasn&#8217;t white hair either.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi, Miss Judy!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi, yourself!&#8221; and Judith stopped her car
in front of the hotel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Boys, that&#8217;s Miss Ann Peyton!&#8221; cried
Major Fitch. &#8220;Miss Ann or I&#8217;ll eat my hat!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s already eaten her wig. No wonder
we didn&#8217;t know her! And she&#8217;s left off her
hoops!&#8221; cried the Judge.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span></p>
<p>The old men removed their feet from
railing, dropped their chairs to all fours, sprang
up and, standing in a row, made a low bow
to the occupants of the little blue car. Then
they trooped off the porch and gathered in a
circle around the ladies.</p>
<p>&#8220;The last I heard of you, Miss Ann, was
that you were lost,&#8221; said Judge Middleton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a bit of it,&#8221; declared Judith. &#8220;She is
found.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;and I think I&#8217;ve found myself, too,&#8221;
said Miss Ann softly. &#8220;I am visiting my dear
young cousin, Judith Buck.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At my urgent invitation,&#8221; explained Judith.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am staying on at her invitation, but I
followed my usual habit and went uninvited,&#8221;
said the old lady firmly.</p>
<p>The old men listened in amazement. What
was this? Miss Ann Peyton openly claiming
relationship with old Dick Buck&#8217;s granddaughter
and riding around&mdash;minus wig and hoops&mdash;with
the new-found cousin in a home-made
blue car! Miss Ann was meek but happy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I swan!&#8221; exclaimed Pete Barnes.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you suppose he meant by saying
they thought you were lost?&#8221; Judith asked on
the way home from Ryeville. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t they
know you were coming to me?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; faltered Miss Ann. &#8220;I seldom
divulge where I intend to visit next. That is
my affair,&#8221; she added with a touch of her former
hauteur&mdash;a manner she had discarded with the
wig and hoop skirt. Wild horses could not drag
from her the fact that she had not known herself
where she was going.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right, Cousin Ann, but if you
ever get tired of staying at my house I am going
to be hurt beyond measure if you go off without
telling me where you are going. Promise
me you&#8217;ll never treat me that way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I promise. I have never told the others
because it has never made any difference to
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the blue car disappeared up the street
the old men of Ryeville went into conference.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t that beat bobtail?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you fellows realize that means our gal
is recognized for good and all? Miss Ann may
be played out as a visitor with her kinfolks, but
she&#8217;s still head forester of the family tree,&#8221; said
Judge Middleton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you reckon we&#8217;d better &#8217;phone Buck
Hill or Big Josh or some of the family that
Miss Ann is found?&#8221; asked Pete Barnes.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, let&#8217;s let &#8217;em worry a while longer.
They&#8217;ve been kinder careless of Miss Ann to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
have mislaid her, and mighty snobbish with our
gal not to have claimed kin with her long ago.
My advice is let &#8217;em worry, let &#8217;em worry,&#8221; decreed
Major Fitch.</p>
<p>Miss Ann wasn&#8217;t lost very long, however.
That same evening, when Judith made her daily
trip to the trolley stop with the men&#8217;s dinner,
Jefferson Bucknor stepped from the rear platform
of the six-thirty.</p>
<p>&#8220;In time to carry your &#8216;empties&#8217; for you,&#8221;
he said, shaking Judith&#8217;s hand with a warmth
that his casual greeting did not warrant. Judith
surrendered the basket, but held on to the
empty milk can.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your trusty weapon,&#8221; said Jeff, and they
both laughed. &#8220;Have you knocked anybody
down lately?&#8221; the young man asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not many, but I am always prepared with
my milk can. It is a deadly weapon, with or
without buttermilk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if you are anywhere near so glad
to see me as I am to see you. I have been
sticking to business and trying to make believe
that Louisville is as nice as Ryeville, and Louisville
girls are as beautiful as they are reputed
to be, and that the law is the most interesting
thing in the world, but somehow I can&#8217;t fool
myself. Are you glad to see me?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said Judith.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you wouldn&#8217;t swing that milk can so
vigorously. I think a cousin might be allowed
to ask if you are glad to see him without being
in danger of having to take the same medicine
Tom Harbison had to swallow. I&#8217;ve come
home on a rather sad mission, in a way, and still
I wanted to see my little cousin so much I can&#8217;t
help making a kind of lark of it. I am really
worried very much, and should go to Buck Hill
immediately, but if you don&#8217;t mind, I&#8217;ll hang
around while you get the seven o&#8217;clock dinners
packed and then help you carry them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Judith did not mind at all. &#8220;I hope nobody
at Buck Hill is ill,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but my father is in a great stew over
old Cousin Ann Peyton. She is lost and he
seems to feel I can find her. Why, I don&#8217;t
know, if he and Big Josh can&#8217;t, even with the
help of the marshal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure you can,&#8221; declared Judith demurely,
and Jeff thought happily how agreeable
it was to have someone besides a father have
such faith in his ability.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must come in and wait,&#8221; insisted
Judith. &#8220;There is a fire in the dining-room.
It is cold for September and a little fire towards
evening is pleasant.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span></p>
<p>Jeff entered the home of his newly claimed
cousin with a feeling of some embarrassment.
It seemed strange that he had lived on the adjoining
farm all his early years and that this was
the first time he had been in the Bucks&#8217; house.
There was a chaste New England charm about
the dining-room that appealed to him. It was
a fit background for the tall, white-haired old
lady who was busily engaged in setting the
table as the young people entered. She was
smiling and humming a gay little minuet, as
she straightened table mats and arranged forks
and knives in exactly the proper relation to
each other and the teaspoons.</p>
<p>Stooping and placing wood on the fire was an
old negro man. His back was strangely
familiar to Jeff and there was something about
the lines of the white-haired old lady that made
him stare. She was like Cousin Ann but
couldn&#8217;t be she. Not only the snowy hair and
the simple, straight skirt of her gown were not
those of the lost cousin, but the fact that she
was engaged in household duties was even more
convincing of a case of mistaken identity. It
was old Billy that had flashed through his mind,
when he noticed the fire maker, but old Billy
never engaged in any form of domestic labor
any more than his mistress.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Someone to see you, Cousin Ann,&#8221; said
Judith, putting her arm around the old lady&#8217;s
waist.</p>
<p>Jeff choked and gasped.</p>
<p>That evening the telephone wires were again
kept hot by the Bucknors and their many kinsmen.
Everybody who had been informed of
Miss Ann&#8217;s being lost must be informed of her
being found. Big and Little Josh drove over
to Buck Hill to hear the story of Jeff&#8217;s discovery.</p>
<p>&#8220;And what were you doing at the Bucks&#8217;?&#8221;
Big Josh asked Jeff.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was calling on Miss Judith. In fact, I
had jumped off the trolley at that stop because
I hoped she would be there,&#8221; said Jeff,
his face flushing but his eyes holding a steady
light as he looked into those of his father&#8217;s
cousin. He even raised his voice a little so as
to make sure that everyone in the room might
hear him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well!&#8221; exploded Big Josh. &#8220;You
have beat me to it. I was planning to go to-morrow
to call on our Cousin Judith Buck.
You know she is our cousin, Jeff&mdash;not too
close, but just close enough. She has been
voted into the family when we sat in solemn
conclave and now to think of her proving she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
is kin before we had time to let her know of
her election&mdash;prove it by taking poor Cousin
Ann in and making her welcome! By jingo,
she is a more worthy member of the clan than
any woman we have in the family. I was all
for taking her in because she is so gol darned
pretty and up-and-coming. I must confess I
wouldn&#8217;t have been so eager about it if she had
been jimber-jawed and cross-eyed, but, by the
great jumping jingo, I&#8217;d say be my long-lost
cousin now if she had a wooden leg, a glass eye
and china teeth!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cousin Ann has left off her wig and her
hoop skirts, too,&#8221; said Jeff, &#8220;and old Billy has
trimmed his beard, and, what is more, both of
them were busy helping&mdash;Cousin Ann setting
the table and Uncle Billy bringing in wood and
mending the fire.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did Judith Buck make them do it,&#8221; asked
Mildred. &#8220;She was a great boss at school.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That I don&#8217;t know, but they seemed very
happy in being able to help. Mrs. Buck told
me she was glad to have a visitor. Her daughter
is away so much and she gets lonely. Old
Uncle Billy is established in a cabin behind the
house&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The one old Dick Buck lived in,&#8221; interrupted
Big Josh.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And the old man told me he was planning
to do the fall ploughing with Cupid and Puck.
He says they have plenty of pull left in them
and my private opinion is that Cousin Ann&#8217;s
old coach will not stand another trip.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;See here,&#8221; spoke Little Josh, who was the
practical member of the family, &#8220;this is all
very well, but we Bucknors can&#8217;t sit back and
let this little Judy Buck support our old cousin.
The girl works night and day for a living and
to try to pull the farm her Grandfather Knight
left her and her mother back into some kind of
fertility. Old Billy and Cousin Ann may set
the table and make the fires, but that isn&#8217;t
bringing any money into the business. We&#8217;ve
got to reimburse the girl somehow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She wouldn&#8217;t stand for it,&#8221; said Jeff. &#8220;She
is as proud as can be to be able to have Cousin
Ann visit her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then we&#8217;ll have to find a way that
won&#8217;t hurt her pride. Let&#8217;s send things to
Cousin Ann. It will please the old lady and
at the same time help on our Cousin Judith.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What kind of things?&#8221; asked Mr. Bob
Bucknor, who had been singularly quiet and
thoughtful ever since his mind was relieved as
to his cousin&#8217;s not being lost.</p>
<p>&#8220;The kind of things neighbors and kinsmen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
do for one another in our state and all other
states where neighbors are neighborly and where
blood is thicker than water, and blue blood
thicker than any other kind,&#8221; exclaimed Big
Josh. &#8220;When you kill mutton don&#8217;t you send
me a quarter? Well, send one to the Bucks instead.
When your potato crop was a failure
owing to the bugs getting ahead of you, didn&#8217;t
I share with you? Well, let me share with this
girl. When I harvest, aren&#8217;t all the relations
ready to send hands to help if I need help?
Who ever helped Judith Buck?</p>
<p>&#8220;I bet your smokehouse is full and running
over this minute. I know mine is. Well, let
them run over in the right channel. We can&#8217;t
do enough for this young cousin. Gee, man,
just to think of our being spared the humiliation
of having to go to Cousin Ann and, tell her
that we couldn&#8217;t look after her any longer! I
break out in a cold sweat whenever I think of
how near we came to it.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Cupid and Puck can&#8217;t pull the plough,
how about sending your tractor over and getting
Cousin Judith&#8217;s few acres broken up for her in
three shakes of a dead sheep&#8217;s tail? I&#8217;d do it
if I were closer. Why, jiminy crickets! We
owe her an everlasting debt of gratitude just
for persuading Cousin Ann to step out of her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
wig and hoops, and another one for making
that old Billy trim his beard. I believe his
beard was what made the other darkeys hate
him so, and I know if it hadn&#8217;t have been for
Cousin Ann&#8217;s hoop skirt and wig she would have
been helping the women folk around the house
long before this. What they had against her
was that she was always company wherever she
stayed. I tell you, give me a red-headed girl
for managing!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>Blessings Begin to Flow</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Well, I say it&#8217;s a good thing these cousins
of yours didn&#8217;t decide sooner to recognize you,
Judy, because if they had we wouldn&#8217;t have had
a single chair with a bottom left in it and the
hooked rugs your Grandmother Knight brought
to Kentucky would have been nothing but
holes,&#8221; declared Mrs. Buck. &#8220;I never saw so
much company in my born days and constant
setting wears out chairs and constant rocking
wears out rugs.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t say as it isn&#8217;t nice to have company.
I&#8217;ve been lonesome, in a way, all my life, because
my mother and father weren&#8217;t much hands
at mixing, feeling themselves to be kind of different
from the folks here in Kentucky, and
then I married young, and trouble came early,
and my poor dear husband&#8217;s father wasn&#8217;t the
kind to attract the kind of people my mother
felt were our equals&mdash;but now, sakes alive,
never a day passes but it isn&#8217;t cousin this and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
cousin that, coming to call or ringing the &#8217;phone
or sending some kind of present to Miss Ann.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do they expect Miss Ann to do with
a bushel of winter onions and a barrel of potatoes
and a keg of cider and a barrel of flour and
six sides of bacon, two jowls and three hams,
besides two barrels of apples and a hind quarter
of the prettiest mutton I&#8217;ve seen for many
a day? This morning a truck drove up with
enough wood to last us half through the winter&mdash;the
best kind of oak and pine mixed and all
cut stove length ready for splitting. That old
Billy is mighty nice about splitting the wood
and bringing it in. He&#8217;s the most respectful
colored person I ever saw and the only one I&#8217;d
ever have around.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Buck paused for breath and then proceeded:
&#8220;While you were off teaching to-day
somebody Miss Ann called Cousin Betty
Throckmorton came to call and brought two
daughters and a grandchild. I was mighty
sorry for them to miss you and I told them so.
I think Mrs. Throckmorton rather thought I
ought to have said I was sorry for you to miss
her, but being as she had come to see you and
not you to see her and being as you are a sight
better looking than she is or her daughters or
the grandchild, I put it the other way. Anyhow,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
she was a very fine lady and couldn&#8217;t say
enough in praise of some of our furniture.</p>
<p>&#8220;She asked me where the secretary in the
parlor came from and when I told her it belonged
to my mother&#8217;s side of the house&mdash;the
Fairbankses&mdash;and came over on the third trip
of the Mayflower she said no doubt she and I
could claim relationship, as she, too, was a Fairbanks.
And then she said to Miss Ann that
people in the south paid so much more attention
to relationship than they did in the north and
no doubt she was as close to me as Miss Ann
was to you.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I got out that book your Grandmother
Knight set such store by, with all of
her family written down in it and a picture of
the old original Fairbanks home, and Mrs. Throckmorton
nearly fell over herself reading
it and hunting out where she belonged in it
and finally she found her line and then, sure
enough, she and I are closer relations than you
and Miss Ann. Then she called me Cousin
Prudence and asked me to call her Cousin
Betty. I&#8217;m afraid I can never get the courage
to do that, but it does kind of tickle me for
them to be claiming relationship with me too.
We are the same folks we have always been.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So we are, Mumsy, but perhaps the other
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
fellow has had a change of heart. Does Cousin
Ann like having so many callers?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed she does, and she never stops telling
them what a fine girl you are. Sometimes I
can&#8217;t believe she is really talking about my
little Judy, she makes you out so wonderful.
Mrs. Throckmorton&mdash;Cousin Betty&mdash;said she
had got a letter from Mrs. Robert Bucknor,
written from Monte Carlo, telling all about the
good times they are having. It seems that that
Mildred has caught a real beau. Cousin Betty&#8217;s
daughter said she hoped he&#8217;d be more faithful
than Tom Harbison, and Cousin Betty hushed
up. Evidently she didn&#8217;t want me to know
about Tom Harbison&mdash;not that I want to
know. This beau is a count and rich and middle
aged. It looks as though it might be a match.
All of the ladies, even Miss Ann, thought it
would be a good thing if Mildred married rich
and lived abroad. They didn&#8217;t want anything
but good fortune for her, but I could tell they&#8217;d
like to have her good fortune fall in foreign
parts.</p>
<p>&#8220;At first Miss Ann was right stand-offish
with Mrs. Throckmorton, but that lady went
right up to her and kissed her and said, &#8216;See
here, Cousin Ann, you might just as well be
glad to see me, because I am very glad to see
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
you, and to see you looking so well and so comfortable
and I&#8217;m also glad to see your pretty
white hair and to know you&#8217;ve got some legs.&#8217;
And Miss Ann laughed and said, &#8216;Thank you,
Cousin Betty,&#8217; and then they began to visit
as sweet as you please. Old Billy went out and
made the colored chauffeur go back and see his
house and of all the big talking you ever heard,
that old man did the biggest. I came back to
the pantry to get out a little wine and cake for
the company and I could hear him just holding
forth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor old Uncle Billy! He is proud of
having a house,&#8221; laughed Judith. &#8220;His turkey
red curtains are up now and his geranium slips
started. He has put on a fresh coat of whitewash,
within and without, and his floor is
scrubbed so clean you could really make up
biscuit on it. It is gratifying, Mumsy, that we
have been able to make two old people as
happy as we have Cousin Ann and old Uncle
Billy. I only hope Cousin Ann doesn&#8217;t bother
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lands sakes, child, she is a heap of company
for me and she is a great help. I don&#8217;t
see how such an old person can step around so
lively. She stirred up a cake this morning.
She says she has been clipping recipes out of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
newspapers for years and years but they have
always made company of her wherever she has
visited before and she has never been able to
try any of her recipes. Her cake has got a
little sad streak in it, owing to the fire getting
low while it was baking, but that wasn&#8217;t to say
her fault altogether, as I told her I&#8217;d look after
the fire while she picked out walnuts for the
icing.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had a right good time though while the
cake-making was going on and Mr. Big Josh
Bucknor came to pass the time of day. He
could not stop but a minute but he nearly split
his sides laughing at Miss Ann in a big apron,
turning her hand to cooking. She laughed, too,
and made as if she was going to hit him with
the rolling pin, like that woman in the newspaper
named Mrs. Jiggs. Mr. Big Josh
brought some fine fish as a present. He said
he&#8217;d been fishing and had caught more than he
could use.&#8221;</p>
<p>That evening, after the dishes were washed,
Judith, instead of beginning on the photographic
work as was her custom, sat silent with
folded hands, her head resting against the back
of the winged chair. Her eyes were closed and
her face was tense.</p>
<p>&#8220;Child, you look so tired,&#8221; said Miss Ann.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
&#8220;You do too much. I am afraid my being here
puts more on you than you can stand.&#8221;</p>
<p>In all her many decades of visiting, that
was the first time Miss Ann had ever suggested
to a hostess that she might be troublesome.
Judith insisted she was not tired and that Miss
Ann was a help and no trouble, but the old
lady could but see that there were violet shadows
under the girl&#8217;s eyes and that the contour
of her cheek was not so rounded as it had been
in the summer.</p>
<p>That night, when Billy came to her room to
see if she needed anything before retiring&mdash;an
unfailing custom of the old man&mdash;Miss
Ann was on the point of discussing with him
the evident fatigue of their beloved young
hostess, but before she could open the subject
Billy said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Ann, I done got a big favor ter ax
you. I ain&#8217;t &#8217;lowin&#8217; ter imconvemience you
none, but I air gonter go on a little trip. It
air goin&#8217; on ter fifty years sence I had a sho&#8217;
&#8217;nuf holiday, bein&#8217; as I ain&#8217;t never been ter
say free ter leave you when we&#8217;ve been a
visitin&#8217; roun&#8217;, kase I been always kinder feard
you mought need ol&#8217; Billy whilst you wa&#8217;n&#8217;t ter
say &#8217;zactly at home, but somehows now you
seem ter kinder b&#8217;long here with Miss Judy an&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
her maw an&#8217; my feets air been eatchin&#8217; so much
lately th&#8217;ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; fer me ter do but follow
the signs an&#8217; go on a trip.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Billy&mdash;&#8221; began Miss Ann.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yassum, I ain&#8217;t gonter be gone long. It
ain&#8217;t gonter be mo&#8217;n three or fo&#8217; days, or maybe
five or six, but anyhow I&#8217;s gonter be back here
in three shakes er a dead sheep&#8217;s tail. I kin
see, as well as you kin, that Miss Judy air
kinder tuckered out what with teachin&#8217; an&#8217;
servin&#8217; up them suppers to the street cyar men.
I&#8217;m a thinkin&#8217; that when I goes on my trip I
mought fin&#8217; a good cook ter holp Miss Judy
out. Her maw am p&#8217;intedly &#8217;posed ter nigger
gals, but she ain&#8217;t called on ter be. Me&#8217;n you
knows by lookin&#8217; on with one eye that Mrs.
Buck air mo&#8217; hindrance than help ter Miss
Judy. You ain&#8217;t gonter put no bans on my
goin&#8217; air you, Miss Ann? Looks like it ain&#8217;t
&#8217;zactly grabby fer me ter git a holiday onct
every fifty years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if&mdash;&#8221; Miss Ann tried again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yassum, I done filled all the wood boxes in
the house an&#8217; on the po&#8217;ch. I done split up
enough kindlin&#8217; ter las&#8217; a week. I done scrubbed
the kitchen an&#8217; cleaned out the cow shed an&#8217;
put fresh straw in Cupid and Puck&#8217;s stalls. I
done pick a tu&#8217;key fer Miss Judy an&#8217; blacked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
the stove. I ain&#8217;t lef nothin&#8217; undone, an&#8217; she
ain&#8217;t gonter have no trouble till ol&#8217; Billy gits
back. I done already ax her what she thinks
&#8217;bout my goin&#8217; on a trip an&#8217; she say fer me ter
git a move on me &#8217;kase I needs it an&#8217; what&#8217;s
mo&#8217; she done rooted out&#8217;n the attic a top coat
an&#8217; a pair er boots an&#8217; I&#8217;m a gonter go off
dressed up as good as a corpse.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Billy departed on his trip. When he had
been gone four days and no message from him
had come, Miss Ann was plainly a little uneasy
about the old man.</p>
<p>&#8220;You ain&#8217;t called on to be worried,&#8221; said
Mrs. Buck. &#8220;That old man can take care of
himself all right. I must say I never expected
the time to come when I&#8217;d confess to missing a
darkey, but Uncle Billy is a heap of help
around the place. He saves Judy a lot of
work&mdash;things she never would let me do. I
certainly hope nothing has happened to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nothing had&mdash;at least nothing that his mistress
or Mrs. Buck could have feared. When
Judith went to the kitchen on Sunday morning,
the one day she allowed herself to relax, she
found the fire crackling in the stove and the
kettle filled and ready to boil. Standing by
the table, rolling out biscuit, was a small, old
mulatto woman, wiry and erect. She was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
dressed in a stiff, purple calico dress and on her
head was a bandanna handkerchief, the ends tied
in front and standing up like rabbit ears.</p>
<p>Uncle Billy looked at Judith and grinned
sheepishly. &#8220;Miss Judy, this air Mandy!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you do, Aunt Mandy? I am so
glad you have come to help me. You have come
for that, have you not?&#8221;</p>
<p>The old woman continued to roll the dough
and cut out the biscuit with a brisk motion, at
the same time looking keenly at Judith.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I reckon that&#8217;s what I come for
mostly, and at the same time I come somewhat
to be holped myself. As soon as I git these
here biscuits in the oven I&#8217;ll tell you what
Billy air too shamefaced to own up to.&#8221;</p>
<p>She whisked the biscuits into the oven and
then proceeded, &#8220;Billy air kinder new to this
business, but bein&#8217; as it&#8217;s my fifth I&#8217;m kinder
used to it. Billy an&#8217; me done got ma&#8217;id yesterday.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Got what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ma&#8217;id! I&#8217;m his wedded wife. He done
come down to Jefferson County courtin&#8217;, an&#8217;
bein&#8217; as I done buried my fo&#8217;th jes&#8217; las&#8217; year
I up&#8217;n says yes as quick as a flash. I reckon
Billy&#8217;s been &#8217;lowin&#8217; that so long as he couldn&#8217;t
be my fust, owin&#8217; to delays an&#8217; happenin&#8217;s,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
he&#8217;d make out to be my las&#8217;. I been kinder
expectin&#8217; that Billy&#8217;d come along for fifty-odd
years an&#8217; every time I&#8217;d git a chance to git
ma&#8217;id I&#8217;d kinder put it off, thinkin&#8217; he mought
turn up, an&#8217; every time I&#8217;d bury a husband
I&#8217;d say to myself, &#8216;Now maybe this time
Billy&#8217;ll be comin&#8217; along.&#8217; I been namin&#8217; my
chilluns arfter him off an&#8217; on. There&#8217;s Bill
an&#8217; Billy an&#8217; Bildad an&#8217; William an&#8217; Willy an&#8217;
one er my gals is named Willymeeter. Of
course I knowed he wa&#8217; kinder &#8217;sponsible fer
Miss Ann, an&#8217; I ain&#8217;t never blamed him none,
but I sho&#8217; wa&#8217; glad ter see him when he come

with a po&#8217;ch an&#8217; all. An&#8217; so we got ma&#8217;id.&#8221;</p>
<p>Old Billy had realized his dream at last&mdash;a
house he could call his own, with a porch and
geraniums growing on it, and married to Mandy.
It mattered not to him that he was her fifth
venture in matrimony.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come next summer, we&#8217;ll have a box of
portulac a bloomin&#8217; befo&#8217; the house,&#8221; he said to
Judith. &#8220;I&#8217;m pretty nigh scairt ter be gittin&#8217;
so many blessings ter onct. Sometimes I
kinder pinch myself ter see if I ain&#8217;t daid an&#8217;

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<h3>Uncle Billy Smiles</h3>
</div>
<p>Judith stood on the platform, swinging her
cooler of buttermilk as a signal to the six-thirty
trolley to stop and be fed. Thanks to the help
of Aunt Mandy and Uncle Billy she had been
able to furnish dinners to the motormen and
conductors all during the snows of winter and
the rains of spring. It was June again, and a
year since she began keeping what she called a
basket boarding-house. It had proved a
profitable business. At the same time she had
the undying gratitude and admiration of her
boarders.</p>
<p>The trolley stopped and eager hands relieved
her of the basket and cooler. A young man
swung from the platform of the rear car. Aunt
Mandy had fried the chicken and Judith had
not had to hurry to meet the six-thirty, so there
was no excuse for the heightened color of her
cheeks when she saw it was Jeff Bucknor.</p>
<p>&#8220;In time to carry your &#8216;empties&#8217;,&#8221; he said,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
taking the basket from her. &#8220;Are you glad
to see me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very glad?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, very glad!&#8221;</p>
<p>They followed the path through the beech
grove. &#8220;Can&#8217;t we sit down a minute?&#8221; begged
the young man. Judith complied. It was a
venerable tree that sheltered them, with dense
foliage on twisted limbs, the lower ones almost
touching the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;I so often think of this tree and this mossy
bank,&#8221; said Jeff. &#8220;I have been wondering all
the way up from Louisville if you would sit
here with me a while.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You might have employed your time better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I might have wondered what you were
giving the motormen for dinner. Judith, will
you do me a favor? Please put down that milk
can. I want to ask you something and I&#8217;d be
much happier and feel much safer if you&#8217;d let
the buttermilk can roll down the hill. There
now, that&#8217;s a good girl!&#8221; He gave the can a
push and it rolled away, with much banging and
jangling.</p>
<p>&#8220;First, let me ask your advice. The old men
of Ryeville have sent for me to come and talk
with them. It seems they want me to run for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
the office of county attorney. They say they
are sure their candidate will be elected and I
believe they can control the politics of the
county from their hotel porch. I&#8217;ll accept their
proposition if you will tell me to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should I decide?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Judith, can&#8217;t you see that life isn&#8217;t
worth living in Louisville or anywhere else if
you are not with me? I have been loving you
from the minute I first saw you standing on
the platform swinging your milk can. In fact,
I believe I have been loving you from the time
I saw you on the trolley that day I got back
home. Why I didn&#8217;t love you when you were
such a spunky little kid, tramping around peddling
fish and rabbits and blackberries, I don&#8217;t
know. I must have been a blind fool or I would
have. Anyhow, I love the memory of you when
you were a little girl. Can&#8217;t you care for me
a little, Judith?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe I can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you won&#8217;t mind putting the <i>nor</i> back
on your name?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Jeff. I won&#8217;t mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>Long the lovers sat under the great tree.
The seven o&#8217;clock trolley whistled for the next
to the last stop, but Jeff and Judith did not
hear it. Fortunately for the hungry men, Uncle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
Billy had seen from afar the young people
seeking the shade of the beech grove and when
Judith did not return to the house he had
astutely reasoned that matters of import were
detaining her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, Mandy, give me that there basket er
victuals an&#8217; I&#8217;ll make tracks fer the platform.
Miss Judy an&#8217; Marse Jeff air a co&#8217;tin&#8217; an&#8217;
when folks air a co&#8217;tin&#8217; time ain&#8217;t mo&#8217;n the win&#8217;
blowin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Ann received the news of the engagement
with happy tears and Mrs. Buck said
that it was Judith&#8217;s business and she had always
known what she wanted from the time she was
born. If she wanted Jeff Bucknor, Mrs. Buck
reckoned it was all right. He seemed a likely
enough young man, but she hoped he knew how
to save, because Judith did not.</p>
<p>The old men of Ryeville were satisfied when
Jeff Bucknor told them he would run for the
office of county attorney if they so wished it.
At the same time he broke to them the news of
his engagement. The veterans exchanged sly
glances and laughed delightedly. Little did the
young man dream that they had planned this
political coup for the sole purpose of bringing
to the county the person they considered the
most suitable as a husband for their protege.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It was my idee, my idee!&#8221; Pete Barnes
declared.</p>
<p>The happiest of all the friends of the young
couple was old Billy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Marse Jeff done tol&#8217; me Miss Ann wa&#8217;n&#8217;t
never ter want an&#8217; now, bless Bob, he&#8217;s gonter
come an&#8217; live with us-alls an&#8217; look arfter the
whole bilin&#8217;. I sho&#8217; air glad he&#8217;s gonter come
here instead er us havin&#8217; ter pick up an&#8217; go
wharever he is. The portulac air comin&#8217; up
so pretty in my box an&#8217; my jewraniums air
a bloomin&#8217;, an&#8217; I done made Mandy one willin&#8217;
husband, an&#8217; Miss Ann air so brisk an&#8217; happy
it would go hard on us all ter have ter be
movin&#8217;. A ol&#8217; hen air took ter settin&#8217; in the
ca&#8217;ige which makes it seem moughty homified.
I&#8217;d sho&#8217; be proud ter think me&#8217;n Miss Ann
could live ter see the day that little chilluns
would be playin&#8217; stage coach an&#8217; injun in Miss
Ann&#8217;s ol&#8217; rockaway.&#8221;</p>
